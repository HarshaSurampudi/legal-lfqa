"Stat. § 14-32.1(a), does not make the definition an essential element of the crime pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 14-32.1(e). Therefore, we reject Defendant’s argument that it is not sufficient for the indictment to “merely state that the victim was ‘handicapped.’ ” Furthermore, the indictment provided Defendant with enough information to prepare a defense for the offense of felony assault on a handicapped person. See Leonard, _ N.C. App. at _, 711 S.E.2d at 873 (rejecting the defendant’s argument that the indictment was not sufficient because the indictment tracked the relevant language of the statute, listed “the essential elements of the offense[,]” and provided the defendant “with enough information to prepare a defense”); State v.

Although one of these administrators (Jennifer Bumford) was consulted by Dr. Lloyd when he was conducting his evaluation of plaintiff, it is undisputed that neither of these employees were the ultimate decision-makers with respect to the decision to abolish plaintiffs position. Indeed, when considered in the context of all the evidence, these alleged remarks are too “remote and oblique .... in relation to the employer’s adverse action” to permit a reasonable jury to find for plaintiff.

"the Distribution Agreement effectively destroyed Innomed’s ability to assign its rights to AHP. Because the January 26 agreement was never memorialized in writing, Innomed must point to evidence in the record as to, inter alia, the terms of the oral contract and the terms that ALZA allegedly breached. See Careau & Co. v. Sec. Pacific Bus. Credit, Inc., 222 Cal.App.3d 1371, 272 Cal.Rptr. 387, 395 (1990); see also Khajavi v. Feather River Anesthesia Med. Group, 84 Cal.App.4th 32, 100 Cal. Rptr.2d 627, 646-47 (2000). Innomed has failed to proffer any evidence as to the terms of the January 26 agreement, so it is impossible to determine whether ALZA breached any of the terms of the agreement when it terminated the Distribution Agreement on March 26.

"and the difficulty in detecting the crime, the legislature could have reasonably determined that a severe penalty was required for the offense of disclosing confidential lottery information. Furthermore, we are not free “to set aside the legislative determination as to the appropriate penalty merely because it seems too severe.” State v. Moss-Dwyer, 686 N.E.2d at 112. In light of the presumption of constitutionality of statutes, and the heavy burden on the party asserting unconstitutionality, we are not convinced that the penalty for disclosure of confidential lottery information violates the proportionality provision of the Indiana Constitution.

Both RICO and the EPCA stand alone in grappling with a broad social issue, whereas the RCRA had a closely related statute on which the Court in Meghrig relied heavily. Second, as in both Porter and Mitchell, the government brought the suit rather than a private party like the Meghrig plaintiff, and Porter makes clear that district courts may have “even broader and more flexible” equitable powers where the public interest is involved, 328 U.S. at 398, 66 S.Ct. 1086.

Because the GEO employees were not required to respond to Pollard’s complaint, we have no idea whether they could pursue the government contractor defense were Pollard’s claims to be tried under state tort law. Nor do the GEO employees have any incentive to make such an argument at this stage of the litigation, as their argument rests on the existence of adequate alternative remedies under state tort law which would be foreclosed by the successful invocation of such a defense. Thus, the GEO employees may have a complete defense to liability under state tort law or they may not; we simply don't know. 17 .

In our view, such a theory is too implausible to support a finding of plain error. A contrary holding is not required by the two cases on which Collins principally relies. See Brooks v.

"that may be drawn therefrom, provide a substantial basis for determining that there is probable cause to believe that a search will uncover evidence of wrongdoing. {30} We clarify that the substantial basis standard of review is more deferential than the de novo review applied to questions of law, but less deferential than the substantial evidence standard applied to questions of fact. See State v. Koen, 152 P.3d 1148, 1151 n. 6 (Alaska 2007). Furthermore, we emphasize that the substantial basis standard is not tantamount to rubber-stamping the decision of the issuing court and does not preclude the reviewing court from conducting a meaningful analysis of whether the search warrant was supported by probable cause.

Appellant also contends that the district court abused its discretion when it denied his motion for substitution of counsel at sentencing.

With the dismissal of federal claims against Defendant, there are no pending claims giving rise to federal jurisdiction. 12 U.S.C. § 1819(b)(2)(A). As such, dismissal of pending state law claims is proper because an independent jurisdictional basis is lacking.

Additionally, and as noted by the trial court in its denial of Nur’s motion for a new trial, neither Nur nor his attorney ever requested an interpreter; Nur communicated with the court in English, both orally and in writing; and the evidence at trial showed that Nur communicated with native English speakers in English when orchestrating the crime. Thus, based on the record, we cannot say that the court had notice that Nur had a significant language difficulty. As such, the court’s failure to appoint an interpreter on its own motion was not fundamental error. See, e.g., Martinez v. State, 451 N.E.2d 39, 41 (Ind.1983) (<HOLDING>).

However, while Miller announced a new legal standard for determining whether a state law regulates insurance for purposes of ERISA’s savings clause, Miller involved an “any willing provider” statute, not a state judicial remedy for a claims processing cause of action.

To satisfy the requirements of Rule 32(c)(3)(C), we encourage the sentencing court to address the defendant personally, see Green, 365 U.S. at 304, 81 S.Ct. 653, and allow the defendant to speak on all topics which the defendant considers relevant. See De Alba Pagan, 33 F.3d at 129. The sentencing judge must be explicit when informing the defendant of her right to allocute. See United States v. Edgecomb, 910 F.2d 1309, 1315 (6th Cir. 1990) (<HOLDING>); see also United States v. Navarro-Flores, 628"

In the letter, he makes clear that he is particularly upset at the idea of having a murder conviction on his record. Unlike cases where, for instance, the sentencing court merely failed to make the sentencing consequences clear to a defendant, and it is therefore debatable what the counterfactual scenario would have looked like, here, Neal clearly articulated the alternative he would have explored.

The contract does not confer title upon him. He obtains that by the deed. It confers only the right to call for the legal title, to enforce a specific performance of the contract of sale. Accordingly, legal title to real property does not pass until a conveyance is made by deed; equitable title to the real property, however, passes to the purchaser at the time of sale.

"It is, in any event, incorrect. If Rooney receives a declaratory judgment that the discharge was valid and the revocation invalid, “release ... would follow automatically since, in a second action for a writ of habeas corpus, the prior judgment would have res judicata effect.” Monk, 793 F.2d at 366. It thus does “not matter that he ha[s] not asked for release.” LoBue, 82 F.3d at 1083. Nor may Rooney “avoid the requirement that he proceed by habeas corpus by adding a request for relief that may not be made in a petition for habeas corpus.” Monk, 793 F.2d at 366.

In this case, the trial court explained in its order dismissing Cutler’s medical-malpractice action that the primary difference between Crosslin and the instant case is that Crosslin alleged in his complaint only that his injury occurred at a point after February 24, 2002, and, thus, “Crosslin may [have been] able (<HOLDING>).

Second, after the district court establishes the total amount of restitution owed, the district court considers the defendant’s financial resources to create a schedule for restitution payments. 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(f)(2).

The Taylorville Eisner court suggests that ""collateral"" transferred under the third sentence of UCC sec. 9-402(7) retains any after-acquired property ""obligation"" under which it was originally secured. Id. at 669. Under this reasoning, any property acquired by the transferee at any time after the initial transfer is ""infected"" with perfection under the financing statement listing the trans-feror as debtor. We reject this reading of sec. 9-402(7) because it ignores the four month limitation of sec. 9-402's second sentence and unreasonably burdens a potential creditor with a duty to inquire as to the source of title of all the transferee's assets.

"“I guess so.” In light of the “high degree of deference” that we must give to the factual determinations of the IJ, the inconsistencies in Kostic’s testimony and written sub missions leave us with little choice but to uphold the adverse credibility determination. See Sterkaj v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 273, 278 (6th Cir.2006) (upholding an IJ’s adverse credibility determination where an asylum applicant submitted an inconsistent document without explanation). Because Kostic cannot overcome the IJ’s finding regarding his lack of credibility, he cannot prove that he is eligible for asylum. This also means that he cannot meet the more stringent standards required to qualify for withholding of removal. See INS v.

"as we know it. On the other hand, a decent respect for the collective wisdom of the jury and for the function entrusted to it in our system, certainly suggests that in most cases the judge should accept the findings of the jury, regardless of its own doubts on the matter.

If, after having given full respect to the jury’s findings, the judge on the entire evidence is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed, it is to be expected that he will grant a new trial. 11 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.

Rational Basis Review Instead, since race-based classifications are not in play and plaintiffs failed to show that the New Plan was adopted with a discriminatory purpose, the New Plan must only survive rational basis review; as long as the plan is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest, it must be upheld.

Thus, USCIS has had to interpret the ambiguous terms of the INA to determine what choice of law rule to apply when determining the validity of a marriage for immigration purposes. Turning to the second step of the Chevron analysis, the Court finds that US-CIS’s interpretation of the INA is reasonable.

The error at issue in this case is the lack of congruence or consistency between, on the one hand, the crime as charged in the indictment and found by the jury and, on the other, the crime for which the defendant was sentenced. It is thus possible to view the consequences of this error in one of two ways: either the defendant was improperly sentenced to a greater penalty than the one authorized by Congress for the crime of which he was justly convicted, or the defendant was improperly convicted, because the crime.of conviction was not fully alleged in the indictment and found by the jury.

However, during the early stages of that investigation, DHR discovered that the maternal grandmother had been indicated for child abuse against her own child in 1994, which she had implicitly denied, and that she had repeatedly witnessed the neglect of the children at issue in this case but had failed to report their plight to DHR.

First, he must show that “counsel’s failure to object to the trial closure prejudiced him for the purposes of determining whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel.” Owens, 483 F.3d at 64. n.13. That is the inquiry relevant here, when petitioner seeks to use his counsel’s ineffective assistance to demonstrate “cause” for his procedural default. The séeond showing of prejudice is the “prejudice to excuse his procedural default.” Id.

Although the DCF method is by no means the only appropriate corporate valuation method, the trial court did not err by relying on the DCF method evidence presented at the valuation hearing on the record presented by the parties in this case.

The stipulations filed by the government and defense counsel regarding defendant’s competence provide a complete picture of the defendant’s mental state and demeanor.

The government’s interpretation of Bloate’s waiver — “a motion for leave to waive his right to file pretrial motions”— has several faults. First, Bloate’s “Waiver of Pretrial Motions” does not appear to be a motion. It states that “there are no issues he wishes to raise by way of pretrial motions,” and that he agrees, after discussion with his attorney, “not to raise any issues by way of pretrial motion.” Cf.

"sentence ran concurrently to the federal sentence, and not vice versa. This analysis fails to take into account the effect of the Brazos County sentence, which the TDCJ re-commenced on November 28, 1998, before Mr. Thomas was sentenced in the federal case. After his federal sentence was imposed, he was returned to state custody, still serving a state sentence from Brazos County. Any time he served before being transferred to Burleson County custody was thus state time, not federal time. Also, although the federal sentence was imposed prior to his Burleson County sentence, under the applicable law his federal time did not actually begin to run until he was taken into federal custody, which only occurred on April 5, 2006.

He is not seeking the return of the property he alleges has been taken — i.e., his income tax. As was stated above, Appellant has shown no property interest in the audit itself. There are innumerable cases in which the plaintiff, although having standing to bring a due process challenge, is ultimately found to have no property interest. See, e.g., O’Bannon v.

Competition comes at the time loans are made; cooperation in an effort to collect as much as possible of the amounts due under competitively determined contracts is not the sort of activity with which the antitrust laws are concerned. Moreover, businesses are entitled under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine to act jointly when presenting requests to courts and agencies. See Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v.

"supra, a case which the majority addresses peripherally, we answered the question of whether the Legislature’s delegation of the power to appoint commissioners serving on the Commission on Medical Discipline to a private organization, violated the gubernatorial power provisions of the Constitution and the separation of powers doctrine in the Declaration of Rights. Chief Judge Murphy, writing for this Court, summarized this Court’s jurisprudence and succinctly and clearly articulated that the power of appointment is not an intrinsic executive function, but rather, that the Legislature can modify, control, and abolish any office it has created: [This question] was considered by the Court in Davis v.

Moreover, discretion permits the court to meet the needs of each particular petitioner, and achieve the overall goal of the Act — to provide relief from constitutional deprivations. Thus, I believe that partial summary dismissals in stage one of the proceeding are in accord with the overall legislative scheme of the Act which provides discretion to the trial court.

There is no meaningful distinction between possessing narcotics with intent to “manufacture, deliver or sell,” and possessing them with intent to “manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.” Section 39-17-417 is a categorical controlled substance offense. With the predicate questions resolved, we can finally turn to the actions of the district court. At sentencing, the district court had before it a PSR stating that Defendant had violated one of two crimes — one a categorical controlled substance offense and one not. If Defendant had objected, the district court could not have decided which statute Defendant had violated based on the PSR’s vague description of the offense. Cf.

Thus, the Seventh Circuit concluded in DePaoli that the district court’s grant of summary judgment to the defendant on the plaintiffs disability claim was “premature” because the plaintiff presented evidence that she was “precluded from more than merely the Abbott production line job.” Id. at 673. In sum, because working is generally accepted as a major life activity, and be cause the determination whether a claimant is disabled depends on an individualized inquiry, the district court did not err in concluding that Burns was disabled because his back injury precluded him from performing at least 50% of the jobs previously available to him.

However, it is also clear that Plaintiff has not alleged a breach of any term of the February 1994 agreement (or agreements) that it references in ¶ 18-19.

We see no basis for foreclosing a departure under USSG § 5K2.1 or USSG § 5K2.2 when a defendant helps put into motion a chain of events that risks serious injury or death, even when an intent to harm is entirely absent and the defendant was not directly responsible for the death.

Maraio, 722 F.2d 1013, 1016 (2d Cir.1983) (citing Gomez v. Toledo, 446 U.S. 635, 100 S.Ct. 1920, 64 L.Ed.2d 572 (1980)). Legal Aid is correct, as far as it goes, that the Second Circuit expressly has ruled that Legal Aid is not a state actor. Lefcourt v. Legal Aid Soc., 445 F.2d 1150, 1157 (2d Cir.1971) (<HOLDING>); Housand v. Heiman, 594 F.2d 923, 924-25 (2d"

When making the determination of predominance and superiority, a court must consider, among other things: “(A) the class members’ interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members; (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and (D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3).

Thus, the operative word in section 6972(a)(1)(B) is “may” and a plaintiff need not establish an incontrovertible “imminent and substantial” harm to health and the environment. The existence of a potential harm to health and the environment is enough, when “there is a reasonable prospect that a serious, near-term threat to human health or the environment exists.” Id. at 279.

"only of whether an immigration officer issued a piece of paper stamped “expedited removal order” would render the second sentence superfluous. Rather than being superfluous, however, the second sentence seems to clarify that Congress really did mean what it said in the first sentence — review should only be for whether an immigration officer issued that piece of paper and whether the Petitioner is the same person referred to in that order. It appears that Congress contemplated that courts may not like the restricted review set forth in the first sentence, so in the second sentence, it foreclosed courts from using a more expansive interpretation of the first sentence, as urged by Petitioner.

Moreover, the Court expressly rejected the contention that limitations is the sole prerogative of Congress, because it constitutes a “ ‘substantive’ element” of a claim. Id. at 556, 94 S.Ct. 756. To the contrary, it concluded that “the mere fact that a federal statute providing for substantive liability also sets a time limitation upon the institution of suit does not restrict the power of the federal courts to hold that the statute of limitations is tolled under certain circumstances not inconsistent with the legislative purpose.” Id. at 559, 94 S.Ct. 756.

We leave this determination to the district court in the first instance. Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Saulpaugh the remedy of front pay. The award of front pay is discretionary, and where as here the district court makes a specific finding that an award of back pay was sufficient to make a plaintiff whole, no abuse of discretion can be found.

"which concerns use of rights-of-way for utilities, allows a municipality to impose an occupancy fee on the use of its rights-of-way. Reasoning that the legislature had not given authority to a county to impose such a fee, the trial court concluded that Broward County lacked such authority. It also found that under state law, the county is preempted from imposing such a fee. Upon finding the county’s annual occupancy fee invalid, the trial court declared the entire ordinance void and unenforceable. Broward County argues that because it is a charter county it is vested with municipal powers. It thus has authority to charge telecommunications companies for use of their rights-of-way and such authority was not preempted by state law. We agree.

Murphy argues that the state court unreasonably applied clearly established Federal law when it dismissed the lone holdout juror during deliberations after the trial judge concluded that the juror refused to deliberate.

Indeed, there are no Supreme Court holdings addressing the issue of whether a trial court’s discharge of a juror for refusing to deliberate violates the Sixth Amendment. We therefore reject Murphy’s challenge under § 2254(d)(1). See Carey v. Musladin, 549 U.S. 70, 127 S.Ct. 649, 654, 166 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006) (<HOLDING>). Ill AEDPA also provides that the court may"

The implementing regulations to the above Section note that a reviewing court may only address matters on appeal of a Notice of Determination that were raised by the taxpayer at the collection due process hearing. 26 C.F.R. § 301.6380-1(f)(2) Q-F5/A-F5 (stating that “the taxpayer can only ask the court to consider an issue that was raised in the taxpayer’s CDP hearing”). Courts interpreting these provisions have determined that actions brought pursuant to § 6330(d) are actions for administrative review and, thus, the reviewing district court is limited to the administrative record and the parties are not entitled to discovery or jury trial. See e.g. Community Residential Services, Inc. v. U.S., 2003 WL 21033239 at * 1 (M.D.N.C. May 7, 2003) (<HOLDING>); Carroll v. United States, 217 F.Supp.2d 852,"
"This Court agrees. Accordingly, in order to exclude a debt from discharge under the “wilful and malicious” standard in § 523(a)(6), the creditor must show that: 1) the injuries complained of were the result of an act of the debtor done without justification or excuse; and 2) the debtor acted either intending to cause an injury or with substantial certainty that the injury would occur. Under Massachusetts law, an assault and battery is an intentional tort subjecting an actor to liability if: [a] he acts intending to cause a harmful or offensive contact with t setts case law that civil liability for an assault and battery will not lie if there is a showing of justification or cognizable excuse for the defendant’s actions.

"that Tull required courts to determine statutory damage awards. The Court noted that in Tull, it was “presented with no evidence that juries historically had determined the amount of civil penalties to be paid to the [government,” while in Feltner there was “clear and direct historical evidence that juries, both as a general matter and in copyright cases, set the amount of damages awarded to a successful plaintiff.” Id. at 354-55, 118 S.Ct. 1279. The Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed the historical nature of the Seventh Amendment right to a trial by jury in federal cases involving punitive damages. Its decisions, taken together, indicate that this right includes the right to a jury determination regarding the amount of punitive damages. See Capital Solutions, 695 F.Supp.2d at 1152 (<HOLDING>).

Moreover, while on appeal Boomer perfunctorily states in a footnote that Ting collaterally estops AT & T from arguing that the Communications Act preempts his state law challenges to the arbitration clause, he fails to support this position with any legal analysis or citation. Therefore he has waived that argument. Rekhi v. Wildwood Indust., Inc., 61 F.3d 1313, 1317 (7th Cir.1995). Finally, even had Boomer not waived this argument, because the issue of preemption involves a pure question of law and because Ting is currently on appeal to the Ninth Circuit, we would still conclude that Ting has no preclusive effect.

"the assets at stake were artwork or cash, the Defendants, through a series of complex transactions, have succeeded in moving such assets from trusts and accounts in which the Plaintiff had the right of access, to trusts and accounts in which she did not. Thus, all of the alleged predicates of mail fraud, wire fraud and money laundering are related insofar as they served either to execute the fraud, or mask it. See, e.g., Jacobson v. Cooper, 882 F.2d 717, 720 (2d Cir.1989) (although plaintiff alleged separate acts involving separate properties, relatedness present where all acts had purported effect of depriving plaintiff of his interest in real estate entity).

Thus, he has waived that argument. See United States v. Duncan, 400 F.3d 1297, 1299 n. 1 (11th Cir.2005) (declining to address the Booker implications of firearm and role enhancements because appellant did not challenge those enhancements in his initial brief); see also Wilkerson v.

By contrast, the acts of merely extending a plain invitation, or making a neutral offer to another person, which are unaccompanied by any inducement intended or designed to increase the probability that the person will accept, do not, in their most common understanding, constitute endeavors to “lure.” See American Heritage Dictionary, supra, at 675 (principally defining the verb “invite” as “[t]o request the presence”) and Webster’s Third International, supra, at 1566 (primarily construing the verb “offer” as “to present for acceptance or rejection”).

As the parties agree, this creates a divisible statute because “dangerous weapon” is not defined in the offense conduct; thus not all armed robberies would constitute firearm offenses. The analysis of a divisible statute in the immigration context is analogous to the application of sentencing enhancements in the sentencing context. In the sentencing context, the court applies Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (<HOLDING>); in the immigration context, we apply a"

With respect to the procedural reasonableness of his sentences, Portney contends that the Guidelines relating to U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2 should be given little weight because they were developed based on Congressional mandate, not empirical data.

Obviously, it’s not unusual for participants in a trial to watch the jury, but we want to be sure that the jury is not made uncomfortable. So if I’m correct that the regular attendees have been members of the family or friends of the defendants, I would appreciate counsel commenting to them when and as appropriate that we don’t want to make the jurors uncomfortable, and what’s actually a lot more interesting about a trial is what goes on in the well of the court and from the witness stand as opposed to the jury.

We agree with the defendant. We now turn to the first step in our analysis of whether the defendant was deprived of his due process right to a fair trial by first determining whether summation statements made by the prosecution were improper. If they were not improper, there would be no need to address the second stage of analysis concerning whether substantial prejudice resulted to the defendant. “A prosecutor, in fulfilling his duties, must confine himself to the 124 A. 820 (1924) (<HOLDING>).

Nevertheless, we find Brohawn persuasive to the extent that it articulates one of many considerations that weigh on the question as to whether a declaratory judgment action is proper.
