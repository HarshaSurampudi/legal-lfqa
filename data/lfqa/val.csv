Firstly, New Hampshire is the only state that has this requirement, leading to a lack of availability of the necessary instruments and materials. Secondly, the State claims that this requirement has prevented them from adopting and utilizing emerging technologies in breath testing. Lastly, the State points to the case of Moss v.

"at 406, 79 Cal.Rptr.2d 52. NCAIG raises a separate issue, barely addressed by Maxum, as to whether Max-um breached its duty to defend Mulberry in the underlying litigation. The Policy states: We will have the right and duty to defend any “insured” against any “suit” seeking those “damages”. However, we will have no duty to defend an “insured” against any “suit” seeking “damages” for a “wrongful act” to which this insurance does not apply. In NCAIG’s view, because the Maxum failed to show that Mulberry subjectively believed that the issuance of the fraudulent insurance would result in a claim, it also breached its duty to defend the litigation, and is therefore liable for the default judgment. See Gray v. Zurich Ins. Co., 65 Cal.2d 263, 279, 54 Cal.Rptr. 104, 419 P.2d 168 (1966) (<HOLDING>). The next inquiry is whether the knowledge of",Did Maxum breach its duty to defend Mulberry in the underlying litigation?,Whether Maxum breached its duty to defend Mulberry in the underlying litigation.,"The Policy states that Maxum has the right and duty to defend any insured against any suit seeking damages.

"sex with and propositioning her. His expression, taken as a whole, lends itself to three possible interpretations: Rogers intended (1) to illicit a sexual response from Emily; (2) to communicate his sexual attraction to her; and/or (3) to compel Emily to view a picture of him masturbating. On any of these interpretations, a jury could reasonably find prurient his sexual interest in and pursuit of a child. The jury could also find shameful his desire to expose Emily to such graphic and sexual-ized content. The Supreme Court’s First Amendment jurisprudence emphasizes a distinction between parties who consent to privately receive and possess obscene materials and those who endure unwilling exposure. Compare Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 568, 89 S.Ct. 1243, 22 L.Ed.2d 542 (1969) (<HOLDING>), with United States v.

The three possible interpretations include: (1) eliciting a sexual response from Emily, (2) communicating sexual attraction to her, and/or (3) compelling Emily to view a picture of him masturbating. Based on these interpretations, the jury could reasonably find prurient the defendant's sexual interest in and pursuit of a child. Furthermore, the jury could also find shameful his desire to expose Emily to such explicit and sexualized content. In terms of legal rules, the Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudence distinguishes between parties who consent to privately receive and possess obscene materials and those who endure unwilling exposure. This can be compared with the case of Stanley v. Georgia, where the court held that private possession of obscene materials is protected, and United States v.

Therefore, the key issues revolve around the defendant's expression, the interpretations of that expression, and the potential jury findings based on those interpretations, all within the context of First Amendment jurisprudence."

"a third party. As noted, there is no identifiable third party in this case. The transfers are thus properly viewed as either benefiting the Fund or benefiting Bear Stearns. In either case, reliance by Bear Stearns on the mere conduit concept is unavailing. More importantly, once the funds were deposited, and as long as short positions were open, Bear Stearns did not have to respond to directions from the Fund. Indeed, so long as there were open short positions, Bear Stearns was not required to return the money to the Fund and was also able to initiate affirmative measures with respect to the funds. Thus, Bear Stearns’s position is simply not parallel to the traditional bank cases. See Malloy v. Citizens Bank of Sapulpa (In re First Security Mortgage Co.), 33 F.3d 42, 43 (10th Cir.1994) (<HOLDING>); see also In re Chase & Sanborn, 848 F.2d at",How does the position of Bear Stearns differ from traditional bank cases?,Comparison of Bear Stearns' position with traditional bank cases,Legal precedents and principles regarding traditional bank cases,Examination of the unique aspects of Bear Stearns' position and its distinction from traditional bank cases based on the provided legal passage,"Bear Stearns' position differs from traditional bank cases primarily due to the absence of an identifiable third party in the case discussed in the provided legal passage.

"State’s decision to characterize that failure as a finding drat K.S. was incompetent to testify. Yet the record demonstrates the State consistently and adamantly characterized Simpson’s efforts to prevent the witness from testifying as a disqualification issue and repeatedly urged the district court to conduct a hearing on her competency as required by statute. The district court’s failure to focus on the State’s argument or to provide any clear basis for its ruling should not fall upon the State. Instead, I would hold that the district court clearly abused its discretion by failing to identify or isolate any legal basis for its harsh ruling despite the State’s efforts to provide the court with a framework for doing, so.

"attorney is considered a state official in Mississippi....”). Finally, even if Appellees’ failure to identify C.G. Smith and produce her statement was untimely, this conduct is not sanctionable, as the evidence is not germane to the merits of this case. As discussed above, because the evidence shows that C.G. Smith did not provide her statement to the District Attorney until after Ard’s assault, the statement has no bearing on whether Rushing or Lincoln County acted with deliberate indifference. “An appellate court need be involved [in discovery rulings] only when a party’s substantial rights have been prejudiced and the proceeding would have turned out differently had the evidence been disclosed.” Bass v.

Furthermore, according to the rule of appellate court involvement in discovery rulings, the court will only intervene if a party's substantial rights have been prejudiced and the outcome of the proceeding would have been different if the evidence had been disclosed.

"Thus, facilitation of aggravated burglary presents a risk of physical injury sufficient to be classified as a “violent felony.” Sawyers, relying on United States v. Pazzanese, 982 F.2d 251 (8th Cir.1992), argues that criminal facilitation is never a “violent felony” under the ACCA. Although Sawyers commingles the arguments, there are essentially two components to this claim: first, because of the categorical approach, facilitation crimes cannot be classified as a “violent felony” based on the underlying crime; and second, facilitation does not meet the inherent mens rea requirement in the ACCA. The first argument is quickly disposed of. First, criminal facilitation in Tennessee requires the government to show that the underlying crime actually occurred.

"reasoning is nonetheless apropos in cases of addiction. Where the State seeks to introduce drug addiction without first establishing a defendant’s identity as the culprit, his drug addiction has no relevance or probative value as to the motive of an otherwise unknown culprit. In other words, without a sufficient identification of the defendant as the intruder, the necessary chain of reasoning breaks and we need not reach the relationship between drug addiction and motive. In the absence of some identification of the defendant as the intruder, his heroin addiction, though introduced to show motive, would necessarily fill in the missing logical gaps that Rule 404(b) requires a prosecutor to fill. See Gould v. State, 579 P.2d 535, 539 (Alaska 1978) (introduction of heroin (Kan. 2008) (<HOLDING>); Adkins v.

"and resources it expended in 2013.” Applying the well-known principle of “the time value of money” means that spending money on other priorities in 2013 — and reaping the benefits of those investments between 2013 and 2015 — would financially benefit Kawa even if it eventually expends money in 2015 to comply with the mandate. Construing Kawa’s complaint liberally, I understand Kawa to have easily alleged facts sufficient to demonstrate Article III standing in its complaint. Of course, my view on the issue of standing has nothing to do with the merits of Kawa’s complaint challenging the employer mandate’s delayed enforcement under the APA. In fact, any discussion of the merits here would be inappropriate. See, e.g., Mulhall v. UNITE HERE Local 855, 618 F.3d 1279, 1294 (11th Cir.2010) (<HOLDING>).

The analysis of the issue involves applying the principle of the time value of money to demonstrate that spending money on other priorities in 2013 would financially benefit Kawa, even if it eventually expends money in 2015 to comply with the mandate.

"been constitutional under the 1870 Constitution. Since the 1970 Constitution is also silent on the subject, a recall statute would likely be constitutional. The 1970 Constitution gives home rule units broad legislative powers and states that those powers are to be construed liberally. (Ill. Const. 1970, art. VII, §6.) Consequently, a home rule unit could enact a valid recall ordinance. Non-home rule units such as the city of Northlake do not have such power. The issue before this court, however, is not whether a recall procedure can be enacted by ordinance. The question is whether recall can be adopted by municipal referendum. In this respect, the powers of municipalities, whether home-ruled or not, are identical. (See Pechous v. Slawko (1976), 64 Ill. 2d 576, 582-83, 357 N.E.2d 1144 (<HOLDING>).)

"We noted that Stein’s holding was based on the “tessellated scheme” of Rule 4(a) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d), regarding notice of judgment. Id. at 1252 (quoting Stein, 197 F.3d at 426). Because Mackey’s appeal was untimely not for lack of notice, but because his counsel had failed to continue representing him in court — a scenario for which no rule parallel to Rule 77 exists — we concluded that the Federal Rules were not so comprehensive as to leave no room for Rule 60(b)(6). We recognized that “[a] federal habeas petitioner — who as such does not have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel — is ordinarily bound by his attorney’s negligence.” Id. at 1253 (quoting Towery v.

Therefore, it was concluded that the Federal Rules were not comprehensive enough to cover situations like Mackey's, leaving room for the application of Rule 60(b)(6). The court also recognized that a federal habeas petitioner, who does not have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel, is ordinarily bound by his attorney's negligence, but this did not apply to the present scenario.","The reasoning behind concluding that the Federal Rules were not so comprehensive as to leave no room for Rule 60(b)(6) was that Mackey's appeal was untimely due to his counsel's failure to continue representing him in court, which was a scenario not covered by any existing rule parallel to Rule 77.

"is not an element weighing against allowing summary judgment. Rather, it is an issue with respect to the amount of damages to which TKO is entitled that still must be assessed by a finder of fact. Although TKO anticipates it, Reilly does not raise the issue of duress. Therefore, I do not address it. However, given the fact that Reilly held the agreement for a period of one to six months before signing it, and that Reilly had the assistance of counsel during that time period, I note that it would be difficult for Reilly to maintain that he was under such pressure as to have been deprived of his free will or free agency in signing the agreement.

"the plea-agreement-disclosure requirement.

"of the statute as a whole. The government’s argument that simple assault applies only to the “assault prong” of § 111(a)(1) makes little sense when considering § 111(a)(2), which punishes one who “assaults or intimidates” a former federal officer. If simple assault did not apply to the remainder of § 111(a)(1), we would be left with two unavailing alternatives before us: either simple assault does not apply to § 111(a)(2) at all; or that the simple assault provision applies only to the word “assault” of §§ 111(a)(1) and (a)(2). The former does little to carry out the purpose of the statute because it would afford greater protection to those without pr ontext of § 111, the definition of simple assault is conduct in violation of § 111(a) ....”) (emphasis added); Ramirez, 233 F.3d at 322 (<HOLDING>) (emphasis in original).

If simple assault is limited to § 111(a)(1), it raises two problematic alternatives: either simple assault does not apply to § 111(a)(2) at all, or it applies only to the word 'assault' in both § 111(a)(1) and § 111(a)(2). Neither of these alternatives aligns with the purpose of the statute. Therefore, considering § 111(a)(2) helps to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the application of simple assault in the statute as a whole.","Considering § 111(a)(2) is significant because it challenges the government's argument about the application of simple assault in the statute.

"present case, the evidence supports the conclusion that the tool-room transfer precluded Spees from working in “a class of jobs” for two reasons. First, JMI viewed Spees as being unable to weld in any capacity, thereby precluding her from employing the skills that she had acquired during the one-month training program for welding. The tool-room position, unlike a welding position, did not require any special training, meaning that Spees was effectively removed to an unskilled position and precluded from utilizing any of the welding training that she had received. JMI’s belief that Spees could not perform any type of welding work thus weighs in favor of concluding that she was precluded from working in a class of jobs. Cf Dutcher v. Ingalls Shipbuilding, 53 F.3d 723, 727 (5th Cir.1995) (<HOLDING>). The second reason supporting the conclusion",Was Spees precluded from working in a class of jobs?,The issue is whether Spees was precluded from working in a class of jobs.,"The relevant rule is that if an employee is unable to perform a certain type of work, they may be precluded from working in a class of jobs.","Based on the evidence presented in the passage, JMI viewed Spees as being unable to weld, which was a skill she had acquired during the welding training program.

"he or she is innocent of these allegations would do. Wyche and McCord are thus archetypal eicirmsic-fabrication cases. Moreover, the confession cases the majority relies upon are wholly distinguishable. Many of these confession cases involve situations where the police lie to the suspect by falsely claiming that a eodefen-dant has already confessed and implicated the suspect, so the suspect might as well come clean.

Even in those cases that do not involve this precise species of misrepresentation, the misrepresentation is still intrinsic to the case the police are actually investigating. See, e.g., Escobar v. State, 699 So.2d 988, 994 (Fla. 1997) (<HOLDING>), abrogated on other grounds by Connor v.",What specific legal principles are relevant to the issue of misrepresentation in confession cases?,Misrepresentation in confession cases,The rules related to misrepresentation in confession cases,The analysis of how misrepresentation is intrinsic to the confession cases,"The relevant legal principles to consider in the issue of misrepresentation in confession cases involve the use of false information by the police to obtain confessions. In many confession cases, the police may lie to the suspect by falsely claiming that another individual has already confessed and implicated the suspect. This misrepresentation is used as a tactic to persuade the suspect to confess as well. Additionally, even in confession cases that do not involve this specific type of misrepresentation, there is still an intrinsic misrepresentation occurring in the case. This misrepresentation is inherent to the investigation being conducted by the police. It is important for legal professionals to be aware of these principles and consider them when analyzing the validity of confession evidence."

"between the two cannot be clearly erroneous.” United States v. Plancarte-Vazquez, 450 F.3d 848, 854 (8th Cir.2006). Although, after reviewing the sentencing transcript, I find the district court’s view of Clark’s testimony, both on direct examination and on cross, to be a real stretch, I cannot say it is clearly impermissible. Thus, I must determine whether Brown was a supervisor or manager based on the district court’s view of the evidence, rather than Brown’s view. Under our precedent, although it is a very close call, I cannot say the district court’s determination — Brown was a supervisor based on his use of Clark to drive him to drug transactions, in exchange for food, drink, shelter, and marijuana — was incorrect.

Here, the court reviewed and adopted the PSI, but then found that employment opportunities in prison and after release would enable McCorvey to pay a fine in the amount of $800. McCorvey has offered nothing to show his inability to pay this small amount. As the court noted, McCorvey is only 48 years old, has a college education, and has no medical conditions that would prevent him from being able to work while incarcerated and after release. Thus, it appears that the court sufficiently considered the necessary factors before imposing a fine.

The court also took into account McCorvey's lack of medical conditions that would prevent him from being able to work and earn income to pay the fine. Additionally, the court mentioned that McCorvey has offered nothing to show his inability to pay the fine amount of $800.","The court considered factors such as McCorvey's age, education, ability to work while incarcerated and after release, lack of medical conditions preventing work, and McCorvey's failure to provide evidence of his inability to pay the fine amount of $800."

In their motion, Defendants argue that LPI and LPHI are distinguishable entities and that, therefore, the Court should dismiss all of the claims that are based in part on LPI’s business since LPI is not a named Defendant in this case. The' Court disagrees. The record is literally stocked with evidence demonstrating that there is no meaningful difference between LPI and LPHI. For instance, LPI and LPHI share physical offices and have a consolidated Board of Directors. (Dkt. No. 135-4 at 7). Along the same lines, the two companies file consolidated financial statements and LPHI reports on LPI’s litigation in its annual reports.. (Id. at 10). Miller v.

"Rules “shall be construed to secure the just. . . determination of every action.” The spirit of the Rules favors decisions on the merits, not technicalities, unless the result would be prejudicial to the other party. Since the first three counts of the complaint assert a right to recover jointly, justice is served by construing Rule 3 and Rule 20 as allowing the $185.00 filing fee to commence the wrongful death action. As to count four of plaintiffs’ complaint, the undisputed facts require allowance of the defendant’s summary judgment motion. Count four pleads a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, a claim separate and distinct from the G.L.c. 161A, §21 wrongful death claims set fourth in the first three counts, Cimino v.

The court is not allowed to reexamine the factual findings made by the lower court and can only consider whether the trial court abused its discretion in adopting the magistrate's decision. This means that the court's role is more focused on assessing the trial court's exercise of discretion rather than reweighing the evidence or making new factual determinations. By being bound by the factual findings, the court respects the lower court's determination of the facts and avoids duplicating the fact-finding process. This preserves judicial efficiency and promotes finality in the decision-making process."

"bases for finding Campbell unsuitable for parole in 2006 were properly supported by some evidence, bearing some indicia of reliability. See Biggs v. Terhune, 334 F.3d 910, 915-17 (9th Cir.2003) (setting forth due process requirements and upholding denial of parole based solely on gravity of offense and prior misconduct).

Code Ann. § 5-14-122 for consensual conduct in a public restroom). In addition, our sodomy statute has been used outside the criminal context in ways harmful to those who engage in same-sex conduct prohibited by the statute. See, e.g., Stowe v.

There have been prosecutions under the sodomy statute as recently as 1988, both for nonconsensual and consensual conduct.

"since Elkin lacked standing to file a complaint for support, this action must be dismissed. Accordingly, we remand this action to the trial court directing that the order of support be vacated and the complaint for support be dismissed on the basis of lack of standing. We further direct that Mother be reimbursed any monies paid as a result of the existing support order. ¶ 12 We further note that even though Mother has the parental duty of supporting her child “until [her] child reaches 18 or graduates from high school, whichever event occurs later,” Blue v.

"GDHI took simultaneous title to both the Boat and its storage location— i.e., the Real Property. The parties therefore simply implied that delivery could occur at the same time as the execution of the Dation. Any additional physical delivery of the Boat was not necessary, and the Court concludes that Sharp conveyed the Boat to GDHI when it executed the Dation (on January 5, 2012). As a result, GDHI had no notice of the voidability of the transfer until after the conveyance of the Boat. Moreover, in the Final Order, the Texas Court never restrained Sharp from alienating the Boat; in fact, the TRO, the Temporary Injunction, and the Final Order never mention the Boat. Cf.

"the traditional purposes for similar fact evidence. Id. In this case, the prior kidnapping was clearly not similar fact evidence. Therefore, the focus of the inquiry is on whether it is relevant to the issue of premeditation; that is, whether the prior kidnapping is evidence that the murder in this case was not a heat-of-passion crime.

"of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999). Neither the Rhode Island legislature nor the Rhode Island Supreme Court has yet established or recognized the existence of an independent tort for the spoliation of evidence. While both the magistrate judge and the district court judge concluded that the Rhode Island Supreme Court would not create such a tort, we see no need to delve into the unchartered waters of Rhode Island law and endeavor to prophesize whether the Rhode Island Supreme Court would adopt an independent tort for spoliation of evidence.

Ed. 2d 881 (1994). In this case the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the State, reveals that this murder falls within the scope of each of the above categories. First, the evidence permits the inference that the killing was physically agonizing to the victim. After shooting the victim four times, defendant repeatedly kicked and pistol-whipped the helpless victim.

"reasonable doubt “without regard” to the historical practice of juries. To the extent the district court repeated the prosecutor’s statement in sustaining the defendants’ objection, it was to illustrate that the district court’s instructions would render the prosecutor’s remark irrelevant. And, as noted above, before the jury deliberated, the district court gave the jury detailed instructions on the meaning of reasonable doubt. Even assuming some residual prejudicial effect remained, the prosecutor’s statement did not affect Ortiz’s and Rolon’s substantial rights because — in light of the substantial independent evidence of their guilt — no reasonable probability exists that this statement altered the outcome of the trial. See United States v. Adams, 74 F.3d 1093, 1097 (11th Cir.1996) (<HOLDING>).

"“shall” in subsection (b) of F.L. § 5-1029 is obligatory, not permissive. Indeed, the word “shall” is used throughout F.L. § 5-1029 in its mandatory sense, with the word “may” being used when permissive action is implied, in explicit contrast to the word “shall.” Moreover, as we have explained, the historical context of the enactment of what is now F.L. § 5-1029 indicates that with respect to the alleged father in a paternity action, the testing afforded by that section upon motion has been referred to and treated as mandatory. To be sure, the Court of Appeals in child custody cases and in cases brought under the Estates and Trusts Article has held that it is within the discretion of the court to permit blood or genetic testing.

"their actual knowledge may be imputed to the city. A title VII employer has actual knowledge of harassment that is known to “higher management” or to someone who has the power to take action to remedy the problem. See Nash, 9 F.3d at 404. The “management” and “remedial power” standards blur together, however, when we examine who may be considered “management,” for to be considered a “manager,” a person must have the ability to exert control over employees. This includes someone with the power not only to hire and fire the offending employee but also to take disciplinary action, to provide significant input into employment decisions, to instruct the offending employee to cease the harassing behavior, or to implement other means of taking remedial action.

Nevertheless, Jewelpak contends that it need not show actual prejudice by reason of the failure to publish because § 1315(d) requires only that it show “prejudice to the importing public in general, and destruction of the uniformity that section recognizes.” We disagree, for such a position is without support in the statute and plainly flouts the rule in Heraeus-Amersil, as well as analogous precedents from this and other courts of appeal. See id. at 1582; cf., e.g., Splane v. West, 216 F.3d 1058 (Fed.Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>); Cargill, Inc. v.

It is important to show actual prejudice and destruction of uniformity to invoke the § 1315(d) notice provision. This requirement is supported by the rule in Heraeus-Amersil and other relevant court precedents.

"and the cases that court relied on. Chenoweth offered a string cite of cases it relied on in supporting its proposition that the judgment was void or irregular. Further into the opinion, the court states in obvious reference to its string cite that “the final judgment rendered against the garnishee was void or irregular (depending upon which opinion is followed) _” Chenoweth, 342 S.W.2d at 502. Upon reviewing these cases and subsequent ones, we find that Missouri courts have become accustomed to using the terms “void” and “irregular” seemingly interchangeably (Shanks and Butler), or at the very least have failed to draw a meaningful distinction between the two terms in situations similar to the facts of the present case.

"an “officer of the United States.” Brief for Respondent IBR 16-17. We find this argument unpersuasive. IBR’s broad definition of “officer of the United States” may well be favored today. Cf. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 126 (1976) (“ ‘[O]ffi-cer of the United States,’ ” as used in Art. II, § 2, cl. 2, refers to any “appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States”). But there is no evidence that this was the definition Congress had in mind in 1948, when it enacted § 1442(a)(1) and the companion provision defining “agency.” Indeed, in 1948 and for some time thereafter, the relationship between certain independent agencies and the “Government of the United States” was often disputed.

"the government and the recipient. In Jones, the Supreme Court emphasizes that the amount and nature of notice required by due process must take into account “unique information about an intended recipient regardless of whether a statutory scheme is reasonably calculated to provide notice in the ordinary case.” Jones, 126 S.Ct. at 1716. A fiduciary relationship between the government and the intended recipient certainly constitutes such “unique information” — especially in light of other relationships that have been consistently held to increase the government’s notice obligations.

First, Ion points to language from the specification that both introduces the patent and comments on its preferred embodiment. Ion argues that this language necessarily narrows the dictionary definition of “value” because the specification disavows certain forms that a value can take. If language within the specification disclaims a usage or distinguishes its patent application from prior art on the basis of a different type of use, the claim construction should reflect these self-imposed limitations.

This exclusion is stated in 29 U.S.C. § 1003(b)(1). This analysis suggests that the Wilmington .plan, if it meets the criteria of a 'governmental plan,' would also be exempt from ERISA's coverage.","Based on the analysis of the case Weiner v. Portage County Benefit Plan and City of Barberton Health Benefit Plan, it can be inferred that the Wilmington .plan, if it qualifies as a 'governmental plan' under ERISA, would fall outside of the Act's coverage due to the governmental plan exclusion from 29 U.S.C. § 1003(b)(1). Therefore, the determination of whether the Wilmington .plan qualifies as a 'governmental plan' is crucial to ascertain its exemption from ERISA's coverage."

"of, or immediately after, the return of the verdict.” Azimi v. Jordan’s Meats, Inc., 456 F.3d 228, 240 (1st Cir.2006) (emphasis added). The Azimi court noted that this rule allows a plaintiff to avoid the tactical dilemma that occurs when a plaintiff is forced to choose between asking for only compensatory damages and risking a zero-dollar verdict, on one hand, or requesting a nominal damages instruction and giving the jury an easy “out” on the other hand. Id. Miller argues that this is the dilemma he faced. Before addressing the tactical dilemma issue, it must first be noted that, although .the First Circuit has adopted an exception to Rule 51(c)(2), many circuits that have addressed similar issues have declined to do so. See Oliver v. Falla, 258 F.3d 1277, 1282 (11th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>); Piaubert v. MacIntosh, 10 Fed.Appx. 503 (9th",What is the significance of the exception to Rule 51(c)(2) mentioned in the passage?,Significance of the exception to Rule 51(c)(2),Rule 51(c)(2),"The exception to Rule 51(c)(2) allows a plaintiff to avoid the tactical dilemma of choosing between only asking for compensatory damages and risking a zero-dollar verdict, or requesting a nominal damages instruction and giving the jury an easy ""out"". This exception was noted by the Azimi court in the case Azimi v. Jordan's Meats, Inc., 456 F.3d 228, 240 (1st Cir.2006). However, it should be noted that while the First Circuit has adopted this exception, many other circuits have declined to do so.","The exception to Rule 51(c)(2) mentioned in the passage allows a plaintiff to avoid a tactical dilemma in a legal case. This dilemma occurs when a plaintiff is forced to choose between asking for only compensatory damages, which may result in a zero-dollar verdict, or requesting a nominal damages instruction, which gives the jury an easy ""out"". By allowing the plaintiff to avoid this dilemma, the exception to Rule 51(c)(2) provides a potential advantage in presenting the case and seeking appropriate damages. It's worth noting that while the First Circuit has adopted this exception, other circuits have chosen not to do so."

"v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 24-25, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). The Supreme Court, in Schmerber v. California, addressed this issue directly and found that the compelled administration of a blood test falls within the reach and protections of the Fourth Amendment. 384 U.S. 757, 767, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966). Any forced extraction of blood, therefore, invades one’s expectation of privacy in bodily integrity, and its reasonableness must be adjudged under a Fourth Amendment analysis. In addition, when blood is extracted and analyzed to reveal information derived from one’s DNA, a second intrusion into one’s expectation of privacy occurs. See Skinner, 489 U.S. at 616, 109 S.Ct. 1402; Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 76, 121 S.Ct. 1281, 149 L.Ed.2d 205 (2001) (<HOLDING>).

Because the court finds that the Tofel Firm is not prepared to continue the Porzio Firm's representation, any counsel replacing the Porzio Firm would face insurmountable obstacles in attempting to prepare for the January 8, 1996 trial of the common law claims in this action. On the one hand, failure by this court to grant such replacement counsel a continuance of that trial would result in prejudice to the Laga Defendants. On the other hand, any further delay of that trial would result in prejudice to the other litigants in this matter.

"shall constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting except where a person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting was not lawfully called or convened”). Therefore, since a shareholder may waive notice by attending a meeting and not objecting, one cannot say that the failure to provide a shareholder with notice of a meeting causes the actions taken at the meeting to be void ab initio. Third, both this Court and our Supreme Court have consistently held that the failure to provide a director with the required notice of a special board meeting renders the actions taken at the meeting voidable — mot void — and thus subject to ratification. See Gordon v. Preston, 1 Watts 385 (Pa.1833) (<HOLDING>); Moller v. Keystone Fibre Co., 187 Pa. 553, 41",What happens if a shareholder attends a meeting without receiving notice?,The issue is regarding the consequences of a shareholder attending a meeting without receiving notice.,One cannot say that the failure to provide a shareholder with notice of a meeting causes the actions taken at the meeting to be void ab initio if the shareholder attends the meeting without objecting.,"According to the information provided in the passage, if a shareholder attends a meeting without receiving notice and does not object, it can be considered as a waiver of notice. Therefore, the failure to provide a shareholder with notice of a meeting does not invalidate the actions taken at the meeting. The actions remain valid. However, it is important to note that this analysis is specific to shareholders and may not apply to directors or special board meetings.","If a shareholder attends a meeting without receiving notice and does not object, it can be considered as a waiver of notice.

Shaw argues that it refers to other transactions with 'SUBCONTRACTOR,' which is now Shaw. Bechtel asserts that the parties are using the provision to avoid the absurdity of making A pay B when B owes A. The result would be that A (Bechtel) does not have to pay B (Shaw) because C (Debtor) owes A. The court may need to interpret the intention behind the Offset Provision and consider the arguments presented by Shaw and Bechtel.","The question of whether Bechtel can offset its obligation to Shaw against Bechtel's claim against the Debtor depends on the interpretation of the Offset Provision and the arguments presented by Shaw and Bechtel. Shaw argues that the phrase 'other transactions' in the Offset Provision refers to other transactions with 'SUBCONTRACTOR,' which is now Shaw. Bechtel, on the other hand, asserts that the provision is meant to avoid the absurdity of making A pay B when B owes A. If the court interprets the provision in favor of Shaw, Bechtel may not be able to offset its obligation. However, if the court agrees with Bechtel's argument, it may allow Bechtel to set off its obligation to Shaw against Bechtel's claim against the Debtor. The court will need to analyze the intention behind the Offset Provision and consider the relevant contract assignments to make a decision."

"to buck when the first shot was fired, Appellant continued firing his pistol from atop an uncontrolled horse. Indeed, it was under the circumstances just described that Samantha, seated only a few feet from Jonathan and Gabe, was shot. It is therefore easily seen that if the horse had bucked in a slightly different way as Appellant continued to fire his gun, any of the shots could have hit Jonathan or Gabe as surely as the one that hit Samantha. Appellant’s conduct, as indicated by the Commonwealth’s evidence, exhibited an extreme indifference to the value of human life and created a substantial danger of death or serious physical injury to Jonathan and Gabe. Appellant was not entitled to a directed verdict on these two charges. See Port v. Commonwealth, 906 S.W.2d 327, 334 (Ky.1995) (<HOLDING>); Combs v.

The passage highlights that Appellant continued firing his pistol from atop an uncontrolled horse, which posed a significant risk to the individuals nearby, including Samantha, who was ultimately shot. The passage suggests that if the horse had bucked differently, any of the shots could have hit Jonathan or Gabe. Therefore, it can be concluded that Appellant's conduct created a substantial danger to Jonathan and Gabe, demonstrating extreme indifference to their lives.","The specific aspect being debated or questioned is whether Appellant's conduct exhibited extreme indifference to the value of human life and created a substantial danger of death or serious physical injury to Jonathan and Gabe.

The passage describes how Appellant continued firing his pistol from atop an uncontrolled horse, and the shots could have hit Jonathan or Gabe as surely as the one that hit Samantha. This demonstrates a substantial danger to Jonathan and Gabe's lives and exhibits extreme indifference to their value. Therefore, Appellant was not entitled to a directed verdict on these two charges."

"428, 429 n. 1, 343 S.E.2d 45, 46 n. 1 (Ct.App.1986). 2. Separation Agreements Prior to 1983, the law in South Carolina was unclear as to what specific words were necessary to render a separation agreement enforceable in the family court. In Kelly v. Edwards, 276 S.C. 368, 278 S.E.2d 773 (1981), the supreme court held that an agreement incorporated but not merged in a divorce decree was enforceable only as a contract and that the family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enforce it. Thereafter, in Brooks v. Brooks, 277 S.C. 322, 326, 286 S.E.2d 669, 671 (1982), the supreme court concluded the family court properly held a party in contempt for violating a separation agreement that was not merged in the final decree.

Defendant’s removal is based solely on plaintiffs settlement demand of $75,000.00. This is insufficient to establish the jurisdictional amount for two reasons. First, the mere existence of a settlement demand is not dispositive of the issue of the jurisdictional amount. See, e.g., King v.

If the validity of the underlying conviction or sentence cannot be at issue in a Rule 35(b) proceeding, it makes no sense to say that a Rule 35(b) reduction constitutes a genuine “resentencing” that gives rise to a new “judgment” that imprisons the § 2255 movant.

Additionally, it is noted that the officers did not attempt to intimidate Shoen into remaining at the storage unit and actually recommended that he call someone to pick him up and leave. Shoen willingly answered the officers' questions and allowed them to search his truck bed. These factors indicate that Shoen's liberty was not restrained and his cooperation was voluntary, aligning with the legal standard for a consensual encounter.","Based on the information provided, the encounter between Shoen and the officers can be deemed as consensual. Shoen voluntarily provided information without being coerced, and the officers did not intimidate him or restrain his liberty. Shoen willingly cooperated with the officers' questions and allowed them to search his truck bed."

"can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.” 355 U.S. at 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99. Heeding this mandate, some prevailing case law inclined to the pleading leniency Conley demanded. In securities fraud cases, despite the particularity required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) for averments constituting the circumstances of the fraud asserted and the scienter requirement Hochfelder propounded, some courts permitted generalized pleadings or relaxed specificity of the requisite fraudulent intent to survive motions to dismiss, relying for authority on the language of Rule 9(b) itself, which provides that “malice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind, may be averred generally”. See In re GlenFed, Inc. Sec.

The basis for this overruling is that 1 M.R.S.A. § 409(2) provides a claimant a trial de novo in the Superior Court.

Gaskin, 364 F.3d 438, 468 (2d Cir.2004) (quoting United States v. Morris, 350 F.3d 32, 39 (2d Cir.2003)). Marzo contends that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to realize, when advising him to admit to at least four instances of off-market trades, that Marzo could properly be found guilty on that conduct alone, without proof that he accepted cash kickbacks. We are not entirely convinced that Marzo’s counsel’s advice to admit to some off-market trades was unreasonable, rather than a reasonable strategic choice. See, e.g., Bell v.

"in bankruptcy. As of November 23, 2005, the Debtor owed the Creditor approximately $114,040. A debtor cannot claim an exemption against amounts owed on a secured debt that represents a voluntary encumbrance of property; consequently, the Debtor is not entitled to any exemption in the $114,040 owed to the Creditor. Because the Debtor’s principal residence was sold for $130,000, the Debtor’s entitlement to an exemption based on the transfer sought to be avoided was only $15,960.

"of whether to impose negligence per se should not be made merely by counting how many factors lean each way. Id. at 305-06.

Because the parties briefed this case prior to the supreme court’s decision in Perry, their arguments did not address all of the factors listed by the court. However, McCurdy’s primary argument on appeal is that the standard of conduct defined in section 61(a) is conditional in nature, and, therefore, the statute does not provide an absolute duty sufficient to support the application of negligence per se.

"we cannot say that § 1396r-5(e)(2)(C) has a “plain meaning” that mandates a resource-first approach. The MCCA does not set out a definition of income as that term is used in subsection (e)(2)(c). Further, unlike the district court, we do not read subsections (b), (d)(e) and'(f) as imparting a plain meaning that prohibits the transfer of income pre-eligibility, such that transferred income cannot be included in the community spouse’s income as that term is used in subsection (e)(2)(C). Instead, we believe that subsection (e)(2)(C)’s reference to “income” is ambiguous at best. Indeed, the differing views of the various courts and agencies that have interpreted subsection (e)(2)(C) provide a strong indication that the subsection is ambiguous.

It is advised to consult local jurisdiction and relevant case law to determine the specific outcome in a particular scenario.","Whether a parent corporation can recover for loss suffered by its subsidiary under a business interruption policy depends on the jurisdiction and the specific facts of the case. According to 3 Couch on Insurance § 40:15 (3rd ed. 2003), if a parent corporation and its subsidiaries are covered by the same policy, the rights of subsidiaries are separate and the parent has no right to recover for loss suffered by the subsidiary. However, Wood Goods Galore, Inc. v. Reinsurance Ass'n of Minn., 478 N.W.2d 205, 210 (Minn.Ct.App.1991) allowed the insured to recover under a business interruption policy for lost retail sales at one location after an accident at its remote manufacturing facility, as both facilities were owned by a single corporate entity. On the contrary, Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh v. Anderson-Prichard Oil Corp., 141 F.2d 443, 446 (10th Cir.1944) held differently. It is recommended to consult local jurisdiction and relevant case law to determine the specific outcome in a particular scenario."

The case of Krinsk v. Fund Asset Management, citing Gartenberg, provides guidance on these factors.

"with the majority of circuits that have concluded St. Cyr does not apply to aliens who challenged their aggravated felony convictions by exercising their right to jury trial.

Following the Supreme Court’s analysis in St. Cyr, the Third, Fourth, and Sixth Circuits have held that determining whether a statute has retroactive effects does not entail an inquiry into litigants’ actual subjective reliance on prior law, but rather, a review of what reasonable litigants would consider in a given situation.

"take much to establish probable cause”). Given everything that Raisbeck knew at the time of the arrest, it was reasonable for him to believe that Miller had sold 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) (same). The phone calls that Detective Raisbeck had overheard and the surveillance of the restaurant provided even more corroboration.

For example, Miller entered the restaurant with no apparent legitimate purpose only moments after Nicole had told him she “needed a hundred,” a phrase Raisbeck interpreted as a request to purchase $100 worth of crack cocaine.

"abuse of discretion standard, I concur in the result. 1.

There is inconsistency amongst jurisdictions concerning which standard of review applies to those alleged sentencing errors not preserved at trial. There are at least three categories in which standards of review are applied to sentencing. Some jurisdictions apply the abuse of discretion standard when addressing the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, whereas procedural errors not raised at trial are reviewed for plain error.

This is supported by legal cases such as United States v. Carter, 421 F.3d 909, 910 (9th Cir. 2005), which noted that unmarked firearms have a greater potential for illicit use. Therefore, there would appear to be no compelling reason why a law-abiding citizen would prefer an unmarked firearm, as they have value primarily for persons seeking to use them for illicit purposes."

"be designed specifically to accommodate creditors like LVNV, who claim to be unable to produce documents. Given these provisions, it is difficult to understand how providing a summary of documents supporting a claim, or at least providing an explanation for why the proof of claim has nothing attached to it, unduly burdens creditors. The only explanation could be that certain creditors wish to continue their routine of executing and filing proofs of claim without objection and without any evidence — essentially, without having to do any work. This practice violates the Bankruptcy Rules and undermines the bedrock notion of the legal system that claimants bear the burden of proving their claims. See Raleigh v. Ill. Dep’t of Revenue, 530 U.S. 15, 21, 120 S.Ct. 1951, 147 L.Ed.2d 13 (2000) (<HOLDING>).

Any objection to this requirement could indicate that certain creditors wish to continue filing proofs of claim without any evidence or effort, which is a violation of the bankruptcy rules. Therefore, providing a summary or explanation does not unduly burden creditors, but rather reinforces the fundamental principle that claimants bear the responsibility of proving their claims."

This situation is not like the Illinois cases that have found defamation per se when a plaintiffs work or conduct while carrying out his employment-duties has been impugned.

Although we do not automatically presume that a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect that to be the case. United States v. Hunt, 526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence well below the statutory maximum sentence also signals reasonableness. See Gonzalez, 550 F.3d at 1324.

"statutory sodomy, and it does pot consist of an attempt to commit the latter offense. Thus, first-degree sexiial misconduct as defined by section 566.090 does not satisfy any of the subparts of section 566.046.1(2) and therefore is not a lesser included offense of first-degree statutory sodomy. Our holding is consistent with State v. Greenlee, 327 S.W.3d 602, 621 (Mo.App. E.D. 2010), in which this Court held that first-degree sexual misconduct, as defined by section 566.090 is not a.lesser included offense of first-degree statutory sodomy because the former requires proof of “lack of consent.” Id.

C. Conclusion [¶ 26] We thus conclude that our decision in Tayman remains valid precedent and should control our decision in this case.

This alignment is based on the understanding that a reliability-based approach ensures the accuracy and trustworthiness of public records, which is crucial for their use as evidence in legal proceedings. The Confrontation Clause right aims to ensure that defendants have the opportunity to confront and cross-examine witnesses against them. However, when it comes to public records, which are not primarily maintained for use as evidence in criminal prosecutions, relying on the traditional requirement of in-person testimony may be impractical and burdensome. Therefore, adopting a reliability-based approach allows for the use of authenticated and summarized routine motor vehicle records as evidence, while still maintaining the reliability and integrity of the information contained in those records. This approach recognizes the modern realities of record-keeping practices and allows for efficient and accurate proof of the content of routinely maintained motor vehicle records."

"pursuing an alibi defense. The Court finds Respondent’s arguments to be without merit. The Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Strickland v.

"applies simply because a reviewing court concludes that, even in the absence of any formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement, the questioning took place in a “coercive environment.” Any interview of one suspected of a crime by a police officer will have coercive aspects to it, simply by virtue of the fact that the police officer is part of a law enforcement system which may ultimately cause the suspect to be charged with a crime.

"the magistrate judge’s finding. Instead, the Millers argue that they are entitled to a less stringent standard because they are not attacking the validity of the foreclosure sale but, rather, are seeking only compensatory damages arising from the sale. The Millers are correct that the above three-part standard — in particular the requirement to show a grossly inadequate selling price — does not apply to all wrongful foreclosure claims* under Texas law. However, the cases on which the Millers rely establish only a particularized exception whereby the plaintiff-mortgagor may avoid showing a grossly inadequate selling price if he or she alleges that the defendant-mortgagee (lender) deliberately “chilled” the bidding at the foreclosure sale.

"the trial court erred in allowing the jury to award mental-anguish damages to the homeowners. Id. The Bowerses argue that, in a negligence case, the plaintiff, even if the plaintiff is not in a zone of danger, should be allowed to recover damages for mental anguish resulting from an incident that causes damage to property if the damage to the property is committed under circumstances of insult or contumely. See Reinhardt Motors, Inc. v. Boston, 516 So.2d 509, 511 (Ala.1986). We disagree. Under Alabama law, it is well established that damages for mental anguish are not recoverable in tort where the tort results in mere injury to property unless the damage to property is committed under circumstances of insult or contumely.

Ordinarily, “ ‘in common usage, the term “person” does not include the sovereign, [and] statutes employing the [word] are ordinarily construed to exclude it.’ ” Will v. Michigan Dep’t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 64, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 2308, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989) (<HOLDING>)(quoting Wilson v. Omaha Indian Tribe, 442 U.S.",What is a 'person' for purposes of the False Claims Act?,The issue being debated is the definition of 'person' under the False Claims Act.,The False Claims Act does not define the word 'person'.,"In common usage, the term 'person' does not include the sovereign, and statutes employing the word are ordinarily construed to exclude it. Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether Texas Tech and TTUHSC, as state institutions, qualify as 'persons' under the False Claims Act.","Under the False Claims Act, the term 'person' is not explicitly defined. However, in common usage, the term 'person' typically does not include the sovereign. This means that Texas Tech and TTUHSC, as state institutions, may not be considered 'persons' under the False Claims Act. Therefore, further analysis is needed to determine their eligibility for liability under the Act."
"value * * * of one-half the share of said farm,” court held that the term “in fee simple” clearly and conclusively imported the testator’s intent to grant a fee simple estate in the grandson.) See, also, Widows’ Home v. Lippardt (1904), 70 Ohio St. 261, 71 N.E. 770, paragraph two of the syllabus, (where will provided “I give and bequeath to my beloved wife all my estate, * * * in fee simple * * *; that after the death of my wife, if there is anything remaining of my personal or real estate it shall be distributed in the following manner * * court held that the wife had the power to sell the real estate and “a deed making such a conveyance, good as against the widow, is good against the second devisees”); Koval v. Koval (C.P.1966), 8 Ohio Misc. 206, 208, 37 O.O.2d 265, 221 N.E.2d 490 (<HOLDING>). But, see, Panzero v. Panzero (Feb. 3, 1989),",What is the significance of the term 'in fee simple' in the legal passage?,Interpretation of the term 'in fee simple',Legal principles related to the term 'in fee simple',Explanation of how the term 'in fee simple' indicates the testator's intent to grant a fee simple estate,"The term 'in fee simple' in the legal passage signifies the testator's intent to grant a fee simple estate to the mentioned individuals. It is a legal term that denotes absolute ownership and control over the property without any restrictions, allowing the grantee to freely dispose of it as they wish. The courts in the cited cases have interpreted the term 'in fee simple' as a clear indication of the testator's intention to grant a fee simple estate. In Widows' Home v. Lippardt, the court held that the wife had the power to sell the real estate, and any conveyance made by her would be valid even against the second devisees. Similarly, in the cited case where the will provided for the distribution of the estate 'in fee simple' after the death of the wife, the court concluded that the term clearly implied the intent to grant a fee simple estate to the grandson. Therefore, the term 'in fee simple' in the passage represents an unambiguous expression of the testator's intent to bestow a fee simple estate."
"venue as to a nonresident co-defendant would vanish and the court would lose personal jurisdiction over the remaining nonresident co-defendant. Ross v. Battle, 117 Ga. 877, 880, 45 S.E. 252, 254 (1903). Defendant argues that the Final Judgment cannot be enforced against him, and that plaintiff should be required to reassert her now eighteen-year-old claim, although defendant argues that the reasserted claims would be barred by the statute of limitations. Defendant’s argument is without merit. The defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and venue are waived as a matter of law if not raised “at the earliest opportunity.” See Euler-Siac S.P.A. v.

In this case, the defendant argues that the final judgment cannot be enforced against him and that the plaintiff should be required to reassert her claim, but his argument is without merit. The law is clear that the defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and venue must be raised at the earliest opportunity, otherwise they are waived.","The significance of raising the defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and venue at the earliest opportunity is that if a defendant fails to do so, these defenses are considered waived as a matter of law.

"claim that neither of these prongs was satisfied. With regard to the first prong, the Defendants contend that the jury did not have a legally sufficient basis to find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the Defendants were objectively reckless. In order to support this contention, the Defendants point to both their non-infringement defense and the invalidity defense of obviousness. The existence of an objective risk of infringement is “determined by the record developed in the infringement proceeding.” Id. The objective prong is not established when the accused infringer puts forward a reasonable defense to infringement, even if the jury ultimately reaches a verdict of infringement.

"the applicable substantive standard. Thus, if the substantive law required clear and convincing evidence to support an element of the claim or defense, the court might grant summary judgment if, in considering a motion for directed verdict on the same evidentiary basis, it would have concluded that the evidence presented was so “one-sided” it failed to satisfy the plaintiff’s burden. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 251-56, 106 S.Ct. at 2511-14. Given this rule, in cases in which the burden is greater than a preponderance of the evidence, analytical constructs that turn on such concepts as “scintilla of the evidence” and “slightest doubt” are no longer useful.

"of alimony, maintenance, or support.” The argument is unpersuasive as an initial matter because nothing in the language of section 523(a)(5) indicates that the dis-chargeability of an obligation turns on state laws regulating alimony and support. Had Congress intended. state law to be determinative, it likely would have stated that intent expressly.

"(noting the general rule that a final judgment from a lower court carries res judicata effect even though it is still subject to review by an appellate court). As to the other district court orders that Mr. Leo purports to appeal, he does little more than reprise the unfounded theme that Garmin’s lawyer is a fraud artist who fabricated evidence (an argument we rejected in Leo, 431 Fed.Appx. at 705) and question the impartiality and abilities of the district court judge who ruled against him.

The court explained: “In our view it would indeed constitute ‘antics with semantics’ to say that litigation with a stale tort claim, one against which the applicable statute of limitations has been specifically pleaded, remains ‘legally entitled to recover’ when his remedy has been taken away!

This means that any defense that would have been available to the uninsured motorist is also available to the insurer. The court in the case explained that it would be futile to consider a litigation with a stale tort claim, one that is time-barred by the statute of limitations, as 'legally entitled to recover.' In order to be 'legally entitled to recover damages,' a plaintiff seeking UM benefits must show that the claim is actually one for the tort allegedly committed by the uninsured motorist. This holding clarifies the relationship between the insured, the insurer, and the availability of defenses in UM benefit claims in North Carolina."

"whether a dispute over a side agreement that does not provide for arbitration falls within the CBA’s arbitration clause, is one that this court has not previously addressed. There is a split among the circuits that have spoken on this issue. The Second, Fourth, and Eighth Circuits apply the “collateral” test in determining whether a dispute over a side agreement is arbitrable. Under the collateral test, courts consider the similarity of the side agreement’s subject matter to the subject matter of the CBA. If the subject matter is dissimilar, the side agreement is deemed collateral to the CBA. However, where the side agreement is “integral” to the CBA, courts permit arbitration of disputes over its provisions. See, e.g., Cornell Univ. v.

"basic underlying relationship. Like a switch from a dealership to a “tight agency” or a restructuring that leaves only the premium business in the dealer’s hands, a termination is surely a “change” in the parties’ relationship. Section 135.03 itself does not distinguish, for purposes of the good cause requirement, among actions that “terminate, cancel, fail to renew or substantially change” the dealership agreement. Thus, if Rexnord was entitled to argue that its own economic circumstances constituted good cause for its attempted change and its ultimate termination of Ziegler’s dealership, we see no logical reason why Zenith cannot attempt to do the same with respect to Morley-Murphy’s dealership. Cf. East Bay Running Store, Inc. v. NIKE, Inc., 890 F.2d 996, 1000 n. 6 (7th Cir.1989) (<HOLDING>). The Wisconsin Supreme Court was careful to",What is the significance of a termination in the parties' relationship?,Understanding the legal significance of a termination in the parties' relationship,Section 135.03 does not differentiate between terminations and other changes in the dealership agreement for the purpose of the good cause requirement,"A termination is considered a 'change' in the parties' relationship and is subject to the same good cause requirement as other actions that terminate, cancel, fail to renew, or substantially change the dealership agreement","The termination of a dealership agreement is considered a 'change' in the parties' relationship and is subject to the same good cause requirement as other actions that terminate, cancel, fail to renew, or substantially change the dealership agreement. Section 135.03 does not distinguish between different types of changes for the purpose of the good cause requirement. Therefore, if one party can argue that their own economic circumstances constitute good cause for a termination or change, it follows that the other party can do the same with respect to their dealership agreement. This interpretation is supported by the case of East Bay Running Store, Inc. v.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court has also been cautious in considering the significance of terminations and changes in dealership agreements."

"On its face, ORS § 652.610(3) prohibits an employer from withholding “any portion of an employee’s wages unless ... [t]he employer is required to do so by law[.]” ORS § 652.610(3)(a) (emphasis added). Because neither the Internal Revenue Code nor its implementing regulations “require” an employer to withhold tax on estimated tips, an employer, like Starbucks, who does so pursuant to the permissive authority granted by federal law is in violation of the Oregon statute. This is precisely the type of conflict that is addressed by federal preemption. When a state law specifically prohibits an activity that is authorized by federal law, the state law must give way. See, e.g., Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, 517 U.S. 25, 32-34, 116 S.Ct. 1103, 1108-09, 134 L.Ed.2d 237 (1996) (<HOLDING>); Watters v.

However, the conflicting federal authority, which authorizes employers to withhold tax on estimated tips, creates a situation of federal preemption. When a state law specifically prohibits an activity authorized by federal law, the state law must give way.

Lorix argues that the sale of rubber-processing chemicals to Minnesota corporations to manufacture products other than tires is sufficiently related to a suit alleging that downstream indirect purchasers paid a supracompetitive price for tires that contained those same rubber-processing chemicals.

Indeed, ... the supervision of the public health and the public morals is a governmental power, continuing in its nature, and to be dealt with as the special exigencies of the moment may require; and that, for this purpose, the largest legislative discretion is allowed, and the discretion cannot be parted with any more than the power itself.

Sandoval-Vasquez also attempts to distinguish Tolar on the basis that the officers here entered the premises with their weapons drawn, yelling that they were police officers and ordering the occupants against a wall.

"(“[A] promise is not good consideration unless there is mutuality of obligation....”); Kunzie, 330 S.W.3d at 483 (citing Baris v. Layton, 43 S.W.3d 390, 396 (Mo.App.E.D.2001)); Krusen v. Maverick Transp., 208 S.W.3d 339, 342 (Mo.App.S.D.2006). Mutuality of obligation “means that an obligation rests upon each party to do or permit to be done something in consideration of the act or promise of the other; that is, -neither party is bound unless both are bound.” Sumners, at 102 S.W.3d at 41 (quoting Aden v. Dalton, 341 Mo. 454, 107 S.W.2d 1070, 1073 (1937)). Accordingly, in a bilateral contract, where no other consideration is found, Missouri courts scrutinize whether the obligations are, in fact, mutual. See, e.g., Greene v. Alliance Automotive, Inc., 435 S.W.3d 646 (Mo.App.W.D.2014) (<HOLDING>); see also Sumners, 102 S.W.3d at 41",What is mutuality of obligation in the context of a promise?,Definition and significance of mutuality of obligation,"Mutuality of obligation means that an obligation rests upon each party to do or permit to be done something in consideration of the act or promise of the other; that is, neither party is bound unless both are bound.","Mutuality of obligation is an essential element in determining the enforceability of a promise. In the context of a bilateral contract, where no other consideration is found, Missouri courts scrutinize whether the obligations are truly mutual.","Mutuality of obligation refers to the principle that both parties in a contract must be bound by an obligation to perform or permit something in exchange for the act or promise of the other party. In other words, neither party is bound unless both parties are bound. Mutuality of obligation is crucial in determining the enforceability of a promise, especially in bilateral contracts where no other consideration is present.

Third, the court of appeals’ method for addressing motions to recall the mandate includes an initial step in which motions deemed lacking in merit are denied with out further review, which suggests that the prompt and summary denial of Mr. Jones’ motion does not necessarily indicate procedural default. Together, these considerations suggest that the court of appeals, as likely as not, overlooked the untimeliness of Mr. Jones’ motion and simply determined that his claims lacked merit. At a minimum, this Court has “good reason” to question whether the alternative was the case. Cf. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. at 740, 111 S.Ct. 2546 (<HOLDING>); Jimenez v.

"as to how long it will last, a reasonable duration may be implied by the nature of the contract or from the surrounding circumstances. The law does not say specifically how long would be reasonable. That’s for you to decide. When a contract fixes no time for its duration, and none can be implied by the nature of the contract and surrounding circumstances, the contract may be terminated at the will of either party. (Appellant’s App. at 495.) Specifically, Pot-latch argues that the district court erred by instructing the jury that it could infer a reasonable duration to the oral contract. Potlatch cites several cases holding that a contract of indefinite duration may be terminated at will. See, e.g., Union Nat’l Bank v. Federal Nat’l Mortgage Ass’n, 860 F.2d 847, 853 (8th Cir.1988) (<HOLDING>); Gary Braswell & Assoc. v.

Here, the Chancellor ultimately found that the University suspended and subsequently discharged Fisler as a result of his poor job performance over an extended period of time following repeated warnings relating to his poor job performance. Continuing and regular poor job performance in the face of repeated warnings certainly meets the requirements for a just cause termination. See, e.g., Wei v. State Civil Serv.

"Graves “had many chances.” R.N., T.N.’s father, testified that Graves’s behavior with Billy was “very peculiar,” such as “riding around the countryside when he should be in school. Putting him up in an apartment. And telling other people that that’s his son.” R.N. further testified that he was “not alleging” that Graves used Billy for “sexual reasons.” None of these statements constitutes evidence of an extraneous offense. Rather, each of the witnesses denied knowledge of any improper conduct with other boys.

"received title— subject to Cox’s repurchase option—to a tract that had been valued three months earlier at nearly $2.5 million. Christopher assumed the outstanding AgSouth mortgage, which had an unpaid principal balance of around $700,000, and paid Banks $500,000 for Banks’s share of the property’s equity. Christopher did not make any payment to Cox for his share of that equity. In other words, Christopher received title to the Cox tract in exchange for consideration equal to about half the property’s value: $1.2 versus $2.5 million. A gross disparity between the sale price and the actual value of the land is evidence of the parties’ intent to create a security interest—a mortgage—rather than a sale. See Russell v.

"that requires special treatment. Each year, the major collections firms handle tens of thousands of payments on behalf of their clients.

This would reduce efficiency at both the client's and firm's office, as valuable time and resources would be spent on the endorsement process. Secondly, such a practice would significantly increase the client's costs. The additional manpower and administrative work involved in endorsing each payment would add to the overall expenses for the client. Moreover, the delay in depositing payments caused by the endorsement process would lead to a higher number of insufficiently-funded checks, further increasing costs for the client.
