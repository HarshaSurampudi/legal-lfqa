"<context> Stat. § 14-32.1(a), does not make the definition an essential element of the crime pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 14-32.1(e). Therefore, we reject Defendant’s argument that it is not sufficient for the indictment to “merely state that the victim was ‘handicapped.’ ” Furthermore, the indictment provided Defendant with enough information to prepare a defense for the offense of felony assault on a handicapped person. See Leonard, _ N.C. App. at _, 711 S.E.2d at 873 (rejecting the defendant’s argument that the indictment was not sufficient because the indictment tracked the relevant language of the statute, listed “the essential elements of the offense[,]” and provided the defendant “with enough information to prepare a defense”); State v.

However, the plaintiffs argue that their arrest cannot be considered a deprivation of liberty pursuant to legal process because it occurred prior to arraignment and without a warrant. In terms of a Fourth Amendment seizure, it is mentioned that there is no evidence before the court regarding the plaintiffs' release on bail after arraignment. <answer> The specific aspects or matters being debated or questioned in the given legal passage are (1) whether the discovery of the cocaine packets provided probable cause to continue holding Valez despite the arresting officer being aware of the intended suspect's arrest, and (2) whether the release of the plaintiffs on bail after arraignment constitutes a Fourth Amendment 'seizure.' These issues are analyzed in relation to the legal rules of probable cause, malicious prosecution versus false arrest, and the definition of a Fourth Amendment 'seizure.' <end>"
"<context> support this conclusion, and nothing points the other way. First, RICO’s statutory scheme resembles the EPCA more than the RCRA. Both RICO and the EPCA stand alone in grappling with a broad social issue, whereas the RCRA had a closely related statute on which the Court in Meghrig relied heavily. Second, as in both Porter and Mitchell, the government brought the suit rather than a private party like the Meghrig plaintiff, and Porter makes clear that district courts may have “even broader and more flexible” equitable powers where the public interest is involved, 328 U.S. at 398, 66 S.Ct. 1086. This point has particular traction if the government is the only party that may seek equitable relief under RICO. See Religious Tech. Ctr. v. Wollersheim, 796 F.2d 1076, 1083-89 (9th Cir.1986) (<HOLDING>).

Efrosman’s petition, filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, challenged the propriety of the BOP’s execution of his sentence, not the legality of the district court’s imposition of his sentence. Placing substance over form, see Cook v. New York State Div. of Parole, 321 F.3d 274, 277-78 (2d Cir.2003), the petition is properly construed as brought under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, see Chambers v.

The courts mentioned in the passage highlight the shift towards recognizing intangible invasions as trespass. <answer> The debate and question in this passage revolve around the definition of trespass. Traditionally, trespass has been understood as an unauthorized physical entry or invasion of someone's property. However, some courts have embraced a 'modern' view that expands the concept of trespass to include intangible intrusions that may not involve physical entry but still interfere with someone's property rights. The passage references different authorities and cases, including the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 158, to demonstrate the different interpretations of trespass. The analysis suggests that the element of damages was presumed in cases of tangible invasions, but the modern view recognizes that intangible intrusions can also give rise to a claim for trespass. The specific cases mentioned in the passage, such as Public Service Co. of Colo. v. Van Wyk and Bradley v. Am. Smelting & Refining Co., exemplify this shift in perspective. Overall, the debate centers on whether trespass should be limited to physical invasions or expanded to encompass intangible intrusions as well. <end>"

JH Properties, Inc., 149 F.3d 517, 523 (6th Cir.1998). Courts have held that an employee merely notifying his employer that he is sick, without more, is not sufficient notice to invoke the FMLA.

This was held by the Sixth Circuit in the case of Brohm v. JH Properties, Inc., 149 F.3d 517, 523 (6th Cir.1998). According to the court, simply notifying the employer that one is sick without providing additional information is not sufficient notice to invoke the FMLA. The employee must explicitly inform the employer that they are suffering from a serious health condition that prevents them from performing their normal job. Therefore, the critical question centers around whether the employee's information is enough to reasonably notify the employer of their need for leave due to a serious health condition. <end>"

Although in Cannon service of process was made on the subsidiary as agent for the parent, rather than on the parent as in the present case, this factual distinction does not affect the Supreme Court’s reasoning concerning when one corporation becomes the other corporation’s agent for severance.

The United States Supreme Court, in the case of Cannon Manufacturing Co. v. Cudahy Packing Co., held that the mere existence of a parent-subsidiary relationship is not enough to justify severance of the subsidiary as an agent for the parent corporation. The Court emphasized that the nature of the relationship and the degree of control exercised are important factors in determining agency for severance. Therefore, it is necessary to consider additional factors beyond the parent-subsidiary relationship to establish agency for severance. <end>"

The requirement that law enforcement authorities must respect a person’s exercise of that option counteracts the coercive pressures of the custodial setting.

In light of the absence of any “meaningful standard by which a court could review the exercise of [the agency’s] discretion,” Def.’s Mot. at 10, and Congress’s choice of precatory statutory language (“may compromise”), the court, supposedly, cannot review the defendant’s decision without intruding upon administrative prerogative. A court may not review an agency action where “(1) statutes preclude judicial review; or (2) agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2); Heckler v.

The relevant rules are the statutes that preclude judicial review or the agency action committed to agency discretion by law. The analysis suggests that the court is bound by the jurisdictional ban on judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in situations where either statutes preclude review or the agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.

This provides evidence of an agreement and Deandre's knowing and voluntary participation in the conspiracy. As for the IBC Bank robbery, it has been concluded in Vernon's appeal that there was insufficient evidence to establish a conspiracy to rob that bank. Therefore, this robbery is not included in the analysis. Lastly, the CVS Pharmacy robbery was not even charged in the indictment, so it is also not considered in the analysis.

First, while NEPA caselaw may provide persuasive authority for interpreting the Compact, it is not controlling. Under NEPA, the duty to study possible mitigation measures stems from the statute’s requirement that the unavoidable adverse effects of a project be studied. See Robertson v.

In this case, defense counsel arguably was trying to use defendant’s not guilty plea as an equivalent of or substitute for defend ant’s testifying. The trial court so concluded and, by these instructions, was trying to neutralize this. Cf People v.

With the dismissal of federal claims against Defendant, there are no pending claims giving rise to federal jurisdiction. 12 U.S.C. § 1819(b)(2)(A). As such, dismissal of pending state law claims is proper because an independent jurisdictional basis is lacking.

Among the factors on which the Board may base such inferences are “the timing of the discharges in relation to the union activity [and] the simultaneous nature of otherwise unconnected dismissals.” Id. at 580. Both the timing and the nature of the discharges in this case suggest anti-union motivations. The firings occurred just as Local 23’s campaign was picking up steam, and the employees, who worked in various different departments, were all dismissed on the same day for entirely disparate reasons. Furthermore, of the eight employees laid off, six were union supporters, and this occurred at a time when only thirteen out of more than one hundred employees had signed cards. Cf. NLRB v.

Second, the possibility that Samuel was the true killer meant that the jury did have a vehicle to acquit. Indeed, that vehicle remained possible in part because appellant did not take the stand and admit to the killing herself. Likewise, defense counsel could have invoked a claim of Self-defense in an opening statement, but by waiving an opening statement, counsel left the jury with the more difficult task of deciding for itself who was responsible for the killing., See id. at 455 (<HOLDING>).

It must be shown that the individual belongs to a protected group, such as being a student or employee of the educational institution. The plaintiff must also establish that they were subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment, meaning that the conduct was unwanted or unconsented to. Furthermore, it must be demonstrated that the harassment was based on sex, meaning that it was motivated by the plaintiff's gender. The plaintiff must then show that the harassment was severe or pervasive enough to create an abusive educational environment, meaning that it significantly interfered with their ability to participate in their education. Finally, the plaintiff must establish some basis for institutional liability, meaning that the educational institution can be held responsible for the harassment.

These statutes provide individuals with immunity from prosecution in exchange for their testimony in certain legal proceedings. Immunity is a creature of statute and varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions, like Texas, immunity is derived from the inherent power of prosecuting attorneys. <answer> Immunity statutes are laws enacted by legislatures to address the tensions between the privilege against self-incrimination and the government's need to obtain testimony from citizens. These statutes grant individuals immunity from prosecution in exchange for their testimony. The privilege against self-incrimination allows individuals to refuse to answer questions in legal proceedings if their answers may incriminate them. However, immunity statutes provide a way to overcome this privilege by offering legal protection from being charged with crimes based upon their compelled testimony. The case of Attorney General v. Colleton highlights the role of immunity statutes in easing these tensions. It is important to note that immunity from prosecution is a creature of statute, meaning it is created and defined by statutes rather than being inherent in the legal system. Different jurisdictions may have variations in their immunity statutes. For example, Professor Whinery cites Texas as a jurisdiction where immunity is not statutory but is derived from the inherent power of prosecuting attorneys. <end>"

S.C. Police Officers Retirement System, the court held that municipal employers are required to contribute to retirement programs even if employees have not filed a written request and paid a special contribution in strict compliance with the governing statute. The court interpreted the principle of substantial compliance, which allows for deviations from strict compliance when there is substantial compliance with the relevant provisions. This ruling enables employees to upgrade their benefits even if they have not followed the exact procedural requirements. <answer> The case Spartanburg v. S.C.

The court ruled that municipal employers must contribute to retirement programs even if employees have failed to file a written request and pay a special contribution prior to retirement in strict compliance with the governing statute. This ruling allows employees to upgrade their benefits despite not strictly complying with the procedural requirements, as long as there is substantial compliance with the relevant provisions. <end>"

While Countrywide argues that Mr. Croye does not meet this definition since he did not execute the loans, plaintiffs have established a question of fact as to whether Mr. Croye was allegedly obligated to pay. Therefore, the determination of Mr. Croye's standing will require further examination of the evidence presented. <end>"

"<context> The continuing violation doctrine “extends the limitations period for all claims of discriminatory acts committed under an ongoing policy of discrimination even if those acts, standing alone, would have been barred by the statute of limitations.” Quinn v. Green Tree Credit Corp., 159 F.3d 759, 765 (2d. Cir.1998) (internal citations and quotations omitted). In this regard, a claim for hostile work environment, “will not be time barred if all acts constituting the claim are part of the same unlawful practice and at least one act falls within the filing period.” Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106, at.

In addition, it is well-settled in the Second <question> What is the continuing violation doctrine and how does it apply to claims of discriminatory acts? <issues> Understanding the continuing violation doctrine and its application to claims of discriminatory acts <rules> The continuing violation doctrine extends the limitations period for all claims of discriminatory acts committed under an ongoing policy of discrimination. A claim for hostile work environment will not be time barred if all acts constituting the claim are part of the same unlawful practice and at least one act falls within the filing period. <analysis> The continuing violation doctrine allows individuals to bring claims for discriminatory acts that were committed as part of an ongoing policy of discrimination, even if those acts occurred outside the normal statute of limitations. It recognizes that in cases of ongoing discrimination, individual acts may not be considered significant on their own, but can contribute to a continuous pattern of discrimination. Additionally, it provides a framework for determining whether a claim for hostile work environment is time barred or not, based on whether all acts constituting the claim are part of the same unlawful practice and if at least one act falls within the filing period. <answer> The continuing violation doctrine extends the limitations period for all claims of discriminatory acts committed under an ongoing policy of discrimination. This means that even if individual acts of discrimination would normally be barred by the statute of limitations, they can still be considered part of a continuing violation if they are part of an ongoing policy of discrimination. For example, in a claim for hostile work environment, the doctrine allows the claim to be considered valid if all acts constituting the claim are part of the same unlawful practice and at least one act falls within the filing period. It is important to note that acts occurring outside the limitations period that are significantly far apart from each other can be fatal to a continuing violation argument. Overall, the continuing violation doctrine provides a framework for addressing cases of ongoing discrimination and ensuring that individuals have the opportunity to seek legal remedies. <end>"

In Batson v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that the use of peremptory challenges to exclude potential jurors based on race violates the Equal Protection Clause. The defense counsel's objection suggests that the removal of the young African-American male juror may be racially motivated. To determine if there was a violation of Batson v. Kentucky, the court would need to consider the reasons provided by the State for exercising the peremptory challenge and evaluate if race was a factor. <answer> The question raised is whether there was a possible violation of Batson v. Kentucky during the jury selection process. In Batson v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court ruled that the use of peremptory challenges to exclude potential jurors based on their race is unconstitutional. In the provided passage, the defense counsel objected to the removal of a young African-American male juror and raised the possibility of a Batson violation. To determine if there was indeed a violation, the court would need to examine the reasons given by the State for exercising the peremptory challenge and assess if race played a role in the decision. Further analysis and evaluation of the facts and circumstances surrounding the juror's removal would be necessary to make a definitive determination on whether a violation occurred. <end>"

Schedule J deals with a debtor’s current expenditures. In the process, it responds to a different filing requirement, contained in 11 U.S.C. § 521(a)(l)(B)(ii). Although line 20 of Schedule J is called a “Statement of Monthly Net Income” and the advisory committee note to the official bankruptcy forms states that this line was added to Schedule J in 2005 “as required by § 521(a)(l)(B)(v),” there is no reason to think that Schedule J is a proxy for the statement of current monthly income required by section 521(a)(l)(B)(v). In fact, the case law suggests the opposite conclusion. See, e.g., In re Turner, 384 B.R. 852, 856 (Bankr.D.Colo.2008) (<HOLDING>). We need not probe this point too deeply. <question> What is the purpose of Schedule J in bankruptcy filings? <issues> Understanding the purpose of Schedule J in bankruptcy filings <rules> Relevant sections of the bankruptcy code regarding Schedule J <analysis> Analyzing the purpose of Schedule J based on the provided information <answer> Schedule J in bankruptcy filings serves as a means for debtors to provide information about their current expenditures. It is a required filing under section 11 U.S.C. § 521(a)(l)(B)(ii), which mandates the disclosure of a debtor's monthly net income. Although Schedule J may include a line called 'Statement of Monthly Net Income,' it is not considered a proxy for the statement of current monthly income required by section 521(a)(l)(B)(v). Case law, such as In re Turner, 384 B.R. 852, 856 (Bankr.D.Colo.2008), supports the conclusion that Schedule J and the statement of current monthly income serve distinct purposes. Therefore, debtors must fulfill their obligation to file both the functional equivalent of a monthly net income statement and the statement of current monthly income. Filing Schedule J alone is insufficient and may be considered too little and too late. <end>"
"<context> Roberts but before Crawford, the Supreme Court expressly relied on Roberts. The Court reasoned that “the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule [Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) ] is firmly enough rooted in our jurisprudence that, under this Court’s holding in Roberts, a court need not inde1 pendently inquire into the reliability of such statements.” Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at 183, 107 S.Ct. 2775.

For example, in Commonwealth v. Flanagan, guilty plea counsel was found to be ineffective for failing to object to a patently defective guilty plea colloquy. In Commonwealth v.

Aiello, supra, at 532. As such, there is no need to consider whether “but for counsel’s ... errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Id. It follows that Mercer’s appellate counsel did not err in failing to assert as a ground for direct appeal in 1987 Mercer’s trial counsel’s failure to object to the reasonable doubt jury charge.

However, when a Muslim receives a confession from a murderer, the duty of confidentiality can be overridden. In Islam, murder is considered a heinous crime that justifies disclosing the confession to the authorities. Therefore, the exception to the duty of confidentiality in Islam applies in the case of murder. <answer> In Islam, there exists a duty of confidentiality, where maintaining the relationship of trust and keeping information confidential is considered important. However, this duty can be overridden in certain cases, such as when a Muslim receives a confession from a murderer. In this scenario, the duty of confidentiality can be set aside, and it becomes the duty of the Muslim to advise the murderer to confess and inform the authorities if the murderer refuses to do so. This exception is based on the view that murder is a heinous crime in Islam that justifies overriding the requirement of confidentiality. <end>"

The officer did not provide any specific reasons or individualized suspicions to justify the frisk, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that Owens was armed or dangerous. The fact that he was a passenger in a vehicle driven by someone who possessed a crack pipe is not enough to establish reasonable suspicion for a frisk. Therefore, it can be argued that the frisk was a violation of Owens's Fourth Amendment rights. <end>"

The Court agrees wit d Cir.2003) (involving misapplication as a career offender, but pointing out that there was no suggestion the crimes were not violent felonies). Duval does not claim to be actually innocent of the crime for which he was sentenced or innocent of the predicate crimes upon which his ACCA status was based; instead, he claims to be actually innocent of being an armed career criminal. He claims that his assault does not qualify as a violent felony, making it legally ineligible for the ACCA. Some courts have rejected similar claims. The Fourth Circuit held, “This argument ... is not cognizable as a claim of actual innocence.” Pettiford, 612 F.3d at 284 (<HOLDING>).

However, Duval argues that his assault does not qualify as a violent felony, making it legally ineligible for the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). <analysis> Duval claims to be actually innocent of being an armed career criminal, specifically arguing that his assault does not meet the requirements of a violent felony under the ACCA. This raises the question of whether such a claim of actual innocence is cognizable. Some courts, like the Fourth Circuit in Pettiford, 612 F.3d at 284, have rejected similar claims, stating that it is not cognizable as a claim of actual innocence. <answer> The claim of being actually innocent of being an armed career criminal is debatable. While the case of v.

The Fourth Circuit, in Pettiford, 612 F.3d at 284, has rejected similar claims, stating that they are not cognizable as claims of actual innocence.

Plaintiff relies instead on a statistical analysis of a company-wide data pool and makes no attempt to narrow the data pool to the locations in which she worked or the positions which she challenges. As this Court noted in the order denying class certification, the probative value of Plaintiffs statistical evidence is therefore highly questionable, in significant part due to the treatment of factors such as experience, education, and specific promotion processes. Cooper v. Southern Company, 205 F.R.D. 596, 613-14 (N.D.Ga.2001). The analytical deficiencies of Plaintiffs statistics diminish the probative value of this evidence such that it cannot by itself support a claim of disparate treatment. See Brown v.

The analysis was conducted using a company-wide data pool without narrowing it down to the specific locations and positions challenged by the plaintiff. As a result, the treatment of factors such as experience, education, and specific promotion processes was not adequately considered. This analytical deficiency diminishes the probative value of the statistical evidence, making it insufficient to support a claim of disparate treatment.

If, after having given full respect to the jury’s findings, the judge on the entire evidence is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed, it is to be expected that he will grant a new trial. 11 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.

However, FELA does not explicitly define when an injury accrues. Case law, such as Urie v.

Therefore, the District Court's conclusion may be subject to scrutiny based on the specific circumstances of Bridgman's injury. <answer> Based on the provided passage, the question of whether the District Court erred in concluding that Bridgman's FELA claims are barred by the statute of limitations arises. The applicable rule states that a railroad employee must file a claim for injury within three years from the date the cause of action accrued. However, FELA does not provide a specific definition for the accrual of an injury, and case law has distinguished between accidents and occupational diseases.

"<context> inquiring whether Congress has spoken to the precise question at issue. Clearly it has not. The Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq.

Turning to the second step of the Chevron analysis, the Court finds that US-CIS’s interpretation of the INA is reasonable. In determining whether a marriage is valid for immigration purposes, USCIS applies the laws of the place where the marriage was celebrated. See, e.g., Matter of Hosseinian, 19 I. & N.

The definition of 'person' under 26 U.S.C. § 6671(b) includes officers or employees of a corporation or members or employees of a partnership. The plaintiffs argue against being categorized as 'persons' by stating that they did not make the decision to stop paying tax funds or to prioritize certain creditors over the IRS. They also claim that Manley had sufficient funds under their control to pay the payroll taxes withheld to the United States. On the other hand, the United States argues that under the line of credit loan and security agreement, the bank has the power to control Manley in case of default, thus categorizing the plaintiffs as 'persons.' Further analysis and examination of the relevant facts and legal arguments would be necessary to determine the exact categorization of the plaintiffs as 'persons' under 26 U.S.C. § 6672. <end>"

It is thus possible to view the consequences of this error in one of two ways: either the defendant was improperly sentenced to a greater penalty than the one authorized by Congress for the crime of which he was justly convicted, or the defendant was improperly convicted, because the crime.of conviction was not fully alleged in the indictment and found by the jury.

The principle behind this statement is that counsel cannot be expected to predict future developments or changes in the law and should not be faulted for not doing so.

"<context> While we agree that the definition of employer requires that the entity “employf] workers under the terms of the W orkers’ Compensation Act,” we disagree that the language requires that all counted workers actually be eligible for workers’ compensation insurance coverage. Section 52-1-15. {9} There are several instances in which a worker is counted to determine whether an employer is subject to the Act but is not ultimately covered under the Act’s provisions. See, e.g., Howie v. Stevens, 102 N.M. 300, 302, 694 P.2d 1365, 1367 (Ct.

The passage provides examples where workers may be counted for determining the application of the Act to the employer, but may not be ultimately covered under the Act's provisions. For instance, an illegally employed minor would be counted to determine application of the Act to the employer but has the right to seek remedies in tort instead of pursuing workers' compensation insurance coverage. <answer> No, the language in the definition of employer does not require that all counted workers be eligible for workers' compensation insurance coverage. The Workers' Compensation Act allows for situations where workers may be counted for determining the application of the Act to the employer, but may not be ultimately covered under the Act's provisions. For example, an illegally employed minor would be counted, but can choose to pursue remedies in tort instead of seeking workers' compensation insurance coverage. <end>"

The passage also states that during the time separating the offenses, Alexis had the ability to cease his criminal conduct and withdraw without committing a subsequent offense. Furthermore, it is mentioned that periods of time far shorter than ten days between offenses can qualify as separate episodes. Therefore, based on the given information, Alexis's three drug offenses would likely be considered as separate episodes under the law. <answer> Yes, Alexis's three drug offenses would likely be considered as separate episodes under the law. The offenses occurred on separate days and there were significant periods of time between them. Additionally, Alexis had the opportunity to cease his criminal conduct during the time separating the offenses. Based on the criteria mentioned in the passage, periods of time far shorter than ten days between offenses can also qualify as separate episodes.

This means that if the affidavit states that proper service was made, it can outweigh the presumption of proper service created by the return of service. <answer> In the context of determining proper service, an uncontradicted affidavit holds significant weight. Both state and federal courts have established the principle that if an affidavit, which states that proper service was made, is uncontradicted other than by the deputy's return, then the affidavit controls. This means that such an affidavit can override the presumption of proper service created by the return of service. Therefore, if an affidavit denying agency or any other evidence contradicting the affidavit is not present, the court may rely on the uncontradicted affidavit to determine that proper service was indeed made. <end>"

There is a strong presumption in favor of the plaintiff's choice of forum, which is entitled to deference. This means that the court generally respects and upholds the plaintiff's decision on where to bring the lawsuit. However, the level of deference given to the plaintiff's choice of forum increases as the plaintiff's connections or ties to the chosen forum increase.

Accordingly, we find the Court of Appeals correctly cited Williamson as supporting authority for its decision. Rooted in Williamson, the law is well-established that evidence of permissive use defeats the establishment of a prescriptive easement because use that is permissive cannot also be adverse or under a claim of right. See Paine, 400 S.C. at 586, 735 S.E.2d at 538 (quoting Williamson and recognizing that a claimant’s permissive use of landowner’s property cannot begin to ripen into a prescriptive easement until the claimant makes a distinct and positive assertion of right hostile to the landowner); Horry Cnty. v.

The law, as established in Williamson, states that use that is permissive cannot also be adverse or under a claim of right. In order for a prescriptive easement to be established, the claimant must make a distinct and positive assertion of right hostile to the landowner's property. <answer> Permissive use has a negative impact on the establishment of a prescriptive easement. When permission is granted by the landowner, there is no adverse use or use under a claim of right. Evidence of permissive use defeats the establishment of a prescriptive easement. This is based on the well-established law that use that is permissive cannot also be adverse or under a claim of right. In order for a prescriptive easement to be established, the claimant must make a distinct and positive assertion of right hostile to the landowner's property, as recognized in the case of Williamson. Therefore, permissive use prevents the development of a prescriptive easement. <end>"

The State, on the other hand, established the expertise of the officer to express the opinion and provided a sufficient basis for this opinion. The case law cited, Hernandez v. State and Hardin v. State, both support the notion that experience may provide a sufficient basis for an expert's testimony. Therefore, the officer's testimony was considered inadmissible due to its unreliability and lack of expertise. <end>"

The government’s interpretation of Bloate’s waiver — “a motion for leave to waive his right to file pretrial motions”— has several faults. First, Bloate’s “Waiver of Pretrial Motions” does not appear to be a motion. It states that “there are no issues he wishes to raise by way of pretrial motions,” and that he agrees, after discussion with his attorney, “not to raise any issues by way of pretrial motion.” Cf. United States v. Bonilla-Filomeno, 579 F.3d 852, 856-57 (8th Cir.2009) (“motion to set a specific trial date” is a pretrial motion); United States v.

Gathering evidence to present to the trier of fact is considered a core function, and individuals enjoy absolute immunity from liability for damages. This means that they cannot be held personally liable for any potential harm caused during the gathering of evidence. On the other hand, when conducting an investigation to determine probable cause for arrest, individuals are protected by qualified immunity. This means that they can be held liable for damages if their conduct was found to be unreasonable or in violation of clearly established laws or constitutional rights. <answer> Absolute immunity applies when individuals are gathering evidence to present to the trier of fact. They are protected from any liability for damages, regardless of the potential harm caused.

As a sovereign nation, the United States cannot be sued without its consent. This principle is supported by legal cases such as Lehman v. Nakshian and Gilbert v. DaGrossa. If the United States has not given its consent to the suit, subject matter jurisdiction is lacking, and the complaint must be dismissed. Additionally, administrative prerequisites aimed at resolving a claim with the relevant agency before filing a lawsuit are generally considered jurisdictional, as the Government's consent to be sued is dependent on adhering to these prerequisites. Therefore, it is essential to obtain the United States' consent before initiating any legal action against it. <end>"

The court in Palmer relied upon cases where recovery was permitted for an invasion of privacy where a picture of a famous person was used. For example, in one case, it was held that a plaintiff-actress could recover when the defendant sold lockets with removable photographs of the plaintiff in each one. Another case allowed recovery when the defendant inserted pictures of widely known baseball players in containers of popcorn and chewing gum. Therefore, the use of a famous person's picture without permission can lead to a successful claim for invasion of privacy. <end>"

"<context> this Lawsuit? Our conclusion that the D’Oench doctrine has not been preempted by statute is reinforced by an examination of Motorcity’s argument that §§ 1821(d)(9)(A) and 1823(e)(1) are inapplicable because Motorcity repaid its loan to Southeast before the FDIC was appointed receiver. Pointing to § 1823(e)(l)’s reference to an “agreement which tends to diminish or defeat the [FDIC’s] interest ... in any asset acquired by it,” Motorcity contends that § 1823(e)(1) does not bar any claims against the FDIC that do not affect the value of a specific asset of the bank, such as a note, acquired by the FDIC. Because it repaid its note, Motorcity argues that there is no longer any specific asset to which the alleged oral agreements relate. See Murphy v. FDIC, 61 F.3d 34, 37 (D.C.Cir.1995) (<HOLDING>); Inn at Saratoga Assocs. v.

They argue that since they have already repaid the note, there is no longer any specific asset to which the alleged oral agreements relate. <answer> Yes, Motorcity can argue that § 1823(e)(1) does not bar any claims against the FDIC. They base their argument on the interpretation of § 1823(e)(1) which they contend does not apply if the claims do not affect the value of a specific asset acquired by the FDIC, such as a note. Motorcity points out that they have repaid their note, therefore eliminating any specific asset to which the alleged oral agreements relate. This argument suggests that § 1823(e)(1) does not apply in their case, allowing them to pursue their claims against the FDIC. <end>"

By providing the defendants and their counsel with the results of the intercepted communications, including transcripts of the conversations, the Government ensures that the defendants are not prejudiced by their failure to receive post-intercept notice.

This could impact her credibility as a witness and may suggest a motive for her refusal to cooperate with the police or admit that J.C. made an outcry statement to her. Additionally, the fact that she was under indictment for this offense may undermine her character and make her less reliable as a witness. <answer> The significance of J.C.'s mother's indictment for failing to report appellant's abuse of J.C. is that it raises questions about her credibility as a witness and may suggest a motive for her refusal to cooperate with the police or acknowledge J.C.'s outcry statement. It also highlights the potential legal consequences of failing to report child abuse, which could impact her character and reliability as a witness. <end>"

In other words, if section 692 grants to a trial judge the power to conduct a preliminary trial and dismiss the proceeding if the applicant fails to prove incapacity, then section 693 must surely permit the same court to appoint a guardian if incapacity is established in that same pretrial hearing. Given this result and its supposed validity, we again wonder why the legislature enacted section 643 if the trial court has the power to sua sponte grant final relief prior to a jury trial. But, because the legislature enacted section 643, the latter must be given meaning. See Holt v. F.F. Enterprises, 990 S.W.2d 756 (Tex.App.—Amarillo 1998, pet. denied) (<HOLDING>).

At oral argument the University contended that these statements are more appropriately considered performance related, and even if they are believed, show an aversion toward age not gender. Either way, the statements are not worth repeating because they fail to show direct discrimination. In order to arrive at the conclusion Markel would have us reach, we would need to infer discriminatory animus into the statements, which we cannot do.

The rationale behind this consideration is that if the defendant had unlawful intent in the extrinsic offense, it is less likely that he had lawful intent in the present offense. To determine if two acts have the same intent, the 'intent' must be defined. In this case, the 'intent' is identified as the 'intent to smuggle aliens' as stated by the United States.

"<context> CANTERO, J., specially concurring. I agree with the majority that any violation of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), would be harmless error in this case. I write to express my belief that whether Apprendi and Blakely can even be applied at the resentencing of a defendant whose conviction and original sentence became final before those cases were decided depends on whether a new jury can be empaneled to decide facts relevant to sentencing. We already have held that Apprendi does not apply retroactively. See Hughes v. State, 901 So.2d 837 (Fla.2005). Presumably, neither does its offspring, Blakely. See, e.g., Hicks v.

State, 901 So.2d 837 (Fla.2005). It can be presumed that Blakely, as an offspring of Apprendi, also does not apply retroactively. Therefore, it is unlikely that Apprendi and Blakely can be applied at the resentencing of a defendant whose conviction and original sentence became final before those cases were decided. <answer> Based on the information provided in the passage, it is unlikely that Apprendi and Blakely can be applied at the resentencing of a defendant whose conviction and original sentence became final before those cases were decided. This is because Apprendi does not apply retroactively, as stated in the case Hughes v.

The relevant legal rule is the Washington statute (Wash. Rev. Code § 26.10.160(3) (1994)) and the historical presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children. The legal analysis reveals that the Court criticized the Washington statute for being overly broad and not giving preference to the best interests of fit parents.

Following Miller, we find the district court properly considered the amended partnership agreement and POA because they were contemplated by or expressly mentioned in the complaint. There is no allegation that the amended partnership agreement or POA were inaccurate or fabricated. Instead, Dittmer argues that the district court should not have considered these extraneous documents on the motion to dismiss, or that the court should have given notice that it was considering them and converting the motion to one for summary judgment.

However, Dittmer argues that the district court should not have considered these extraneous documents on the motion to dismiss, or that the court should have given notice that it was considering them and converting the motion to one for summary judgment. Therefore, the issue is whether the district court acted correctly in considering the amended partnership agreement and POA in the motion to dismiss. <answer> Based on the passage, the district court's consideration of the amended partnership agreement and POA in the motion to dismiss was appropriate. The court found that these documents were contemplated by or expressly mentioned in the complaint and there were no allegations of inaccuracy or fabrication. However, Dittmer argues that the court should not have considered these extraneous documents without notice or converting the motion to one for summary judgment. This argument raises a procedural question that would require further analysis to determine the appropriateness of the court's actions.

In sum, because working is generally accepted as a major life activity, and be cause the determination whether a claimant is disabled depends on an individualized inquiry, the district court did not err in concluding that Burns was disabled because his back injury precluded him from performing at least 50% of the jobs previously available to him.

This means that the claims resolved by the district court and those remaining in that court are treated as separate cases with their own judgments and appeal rights. The court's severance order in this case was classified as one 'pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21', which allows for the severance of claims.

The Court clarifies that the parenthetical reference to a remand 'for [a] determination of whether [a] claim was reasonably raised, when there was an evidentiary factual bases therefore' should not confuse the Board on remand. The focus is on adjudicating Mrs. Reliford's claim based on the existing file, rather than determining whether the claim was reasonably raised. <answer> The significance of the Court's remand in Mrs. Reliford's claim for accrued benefits is that it directs that her claim be processed in accordance with section 5121(a).

"<context> Analysis In his petition, Grant argues that the Montgomery Circuit Court has no sub ject-matter jurisdiction over the administration of Frazier’s estate pending in Lowndes County.

At the time the Lowndes Probate Court issued letters of administration to Grant, it assumed jurisdiction over the administration of Frazier’s estate, including jurisdiction over the “repeal or revocation” of such letters and the resolution of all controversies related to the administration of Frazier’s estate. § 12-13-1, Ala.Code 1975; see also DuBose v.

This provision applies to cases where a final order of deportation has entered more than 30 days after the date of IIRIRA's enactment, which is October 30, 1996. Despite other provisions of the INA in effect at the time of enactment, section 309(c)(4)(E) eliminates the right to appeal any discretionary decision under section 244. In the present case, Kamara's final order of deportation, subject to a motion to reopen, was entered on October 27, 1997, which falls within the scope of section 309(c)(4)(E). This is further supported by the comparison with the cases of Skutnik v. INS, 128 F.3d 512, 513-14 (7th Cir.1997) and Meguenine v. INS, 139 F.3d 25, 26 (1st Cir.). <answer> The court has jurisdiction to review an immigration judge's decision to deny an alien's application for voluntary departure. This jurisdiction is governed by IIRIRA § 309(c)(4)(E), which provides that for cases with a final order of deportation entered more than 30 days after the enactment of IIRIRA (October 30, 1996), there is no right of appeal for any discretionary decision under section 244. In Kamara's case, where a final order of deportation was entered on October 27, 1997, after the triggering date imposed by the transitional rules, section 309(c)(4)(E) applies. This conclusion is supported by the comparison with the cases of Skutnik v. INS and Meguenine v. INS. <end>"

In contrast to the panel opinion, I find these “attenuation” questions to be the dispositive issues before this court, but, on the facts presented, conclude that the district court erred in its determination. As the panel is in agreement that there was a constitutional violation from the officers’ attempt at entry, the predicate for the district court’s reasonableness argument falls away. The district court held that “if the attempt is never significant, the forty-five second period between announcement and actual entry is plainly reasonable under Jones.” See United States v.

Bowen further supports this by stating that 28 U.S.C. § 2412 waives government sovereign immunity as to Rule 11 sanctions. These cases collectively demonstrate that the government is not immune from facing Rule 11 sanctions and is bound by the same rules as other litigants in civil proceedings. <end>"
"<context> end of the spectrum, in that Scott Brooks was an indirect cause of these injuries, but we cannot conclude that Scott Brooks is outside the scope of USSG § 5K2.1 or USSG § 5K2.2. Unintended consequences are often the result of reckless behavior, and while perhaps Scott Brooks could not have anticipated the particular sequence of events, Scott Brooks should have foreseen the possibility of serious physical harm to another as a result of his actions. We see no basis for foreclosing a departure under USSG § 5K2.1 or USSG § 5K2.2 when a defendant helps put into motion a chain of events that risks serious injury or death, even when an intent to harm is entirely absent and the defendant was not directly responsible for the death.

The passage suggests that unintended consequences resulting from reckless behavior can still hold the defendant responsible. Scott Brooks should have foreseen the possibility of serious physical harm to another as a result of his actions. The passage cites previous cases like United States v. Diaz and United States v. Fortier to support this reasoning. <answer> Based on the analysis of the passage, Scott Brooks' actions may fall within the scope of USSG § 5K2.1 or USSG § 5K2.2. Even though Brooks was not directly responsible for the injuries and did not have an intent to harm, the passage suggests that he could still be held accountable for the unintended consequences resulting from his reckless behavior. The passage cites previous cases as supporting precedent for this interpretation. <end>"

We cannot say that Fleming’s denial of further medical services and treatment in July 1993 justified Henderson’s disdain for the Commission’s procedures as set forth in the fee schedule. Henderson has cited several cases in his brief to this Court where the Mississippi Supreme Court has upheld a claimant’s right to secure medical services on his own elsewhere after the employer/earrier refused to provide medical services and supplies to the injured employee and that the employer/earrier should be held liable for the medical services selected by the injured employee.

Although we may question the prudence of giving a juvenile a right without imposing a corresponding duty on the police to inform the juvenile of that right, that is a policy decision properly left to the legislature, and not this court. See Norton v. Hinson, 337 Ark. 487, 989 S.W.2d 535 (1999); McDonald v. Pettus, 337 Ark. 265, 989 S.W.2d 9 (1999) (<HOLDING>).

State. The passage explains that the juvenile's rights in such proceedings are defined by the constitution and the juvenile statute, and no such right to assert the insanity defense can be found within these sources. While there may be a question about the prudence of granting a right without imposing a corresponding duty on the police to inform the juvenile of that right, this is a policy decision left to the legislature and not the court.

Plaintiff responded that the implied warranty of habitability has never been limited to only builder-vendors, and that the policies underlying the warranty apply equally well to builders.

Neither the Supreme Court nor this court has ever adopted a rule limiting protection to practices that are compelled by a litigant’s religion. We decline to adopt such a rule today. C. The Impingement Threshold The fact that the First Amendment does not protect only compelled religious conduct does not mean that the Constitution forbids all constraints on religiously motivated conduct, however trivial. Instead, the First Amendment is implicated when a law or regulation imposes a substantial, as opposed to inconsequential, burden on the litigant’s religious practice. Our cases make clear that this threshold showing must be made before the First Amendment is implicated. See Branch Ministries v. Rossotti, 211 F.3d 137, 142 (D.C.Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>).

The ACLU contends that cell tower dumps violate reasonable expectations of privacy “because they involve just th[is] sort of ‘dragnet type’ surveillance of hundreds or thousands of innocent people.” (Wessler 5/20/14 Letter at 13). I cannot agree that the Government’s application here raises the spectre of “wholesale surveillance” suggested in Knotts and some of the cases following it. Such concerns center on the possibility of the Government tracking an individual’s (or a number of individuals’) every movement over a period of time.

While the ACLU argues that cell tower dumps involve 'dragnet type' surveillance of innocent people, the court disagrees and states that the government's application here does not raise concerns about wholesale surveillance. Wholesale surveillance refers to tracking an individual's or multiple individuals' every movement over a period of time, which is different from the use of cell tower dumps. <end>"

Government Exemption The Basts first argue that the district court improperly granted summary judgment because there is an issue of fact as to whether the Plan was managed by an agency of the government. ERISA exempts from preemption any plan that is established or maintained by the U.S. government, a state government or by any agency or instrumentality of the government. 29 U.S.C. § 1002(32); 29 U.S.C. § 1003(b)(1).

To determine whether the Plan in question is exempted, it is necessary to evaluate whether it was managed by an agency of the government. <answer> ERISA exempts from preemption any plan that is established or maintained by the U.S. government, a state government, or by any agency or instrumentality of the government. In this case, the Basts argue that the district court improperly granted summary judgment because there is an issue of fact as to whether the Plan was managed by an agency of the government. The issue is whether the Plan qualifies for the government exemption under ERISA. The specific rules of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1002(32) and 29 U.S.C. § 1003(b)(1), state that a plan can be exempted if it is established or maintained by the U.S. government, a state government, or any agency or instrumentality of the government.

Moreover, as noted by Mrs. Padgett, the Secretary failed to take any position on the Court’s “cleai'ly erroneous” standard of review at the administrative stage of the proceedings, but rather the Secretary only took such a position on the issue after the Board rendered its decision and Mr. Pad-gett had filed his initial appeal to the Court.

Additionally, Mrs. Padgett points out that the Secretary did not take a position on the Court's 'clearly erroneous' standard of review until after the Board rendered its decision.

This case involved voluminous discovery, a large number of counts, several defendants, ongoing investigations in other districts, and potential witnesses from other countries.

Based on similar circumstances in the past, 'ends of justice' continuances were considered necessary to ensure a fair and efficient trial process. These continuances are granted under the authority of the relevant legal provision, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A), which allows for reasonable delays in criminal cases to serve the interests of justice, including complexity of the case. In this particular case, the complexity arises from the fact that multiple defendants are involved, there are ongoing investigations in different states, and there is evidence that needs to be collected from witnesses located in other countries. By granting the continuances, the court recognizes the need for sufficient time to conduct a thorough investigation, prepare for trial, and ensure the rights of the defendants to a speedy trial are balanced with the interests of justice. <end>"

On the other hand, the language could be read to refer to the most recent order establishing a child support obligation, which also defines the duty to support. Our view is that our General Assembly intended the latter. At the outset, we make two observations regarding Indiana Code section 31-16-6-6 that guide us in our interpretation. First, there is no common law duty for a parent to support his or her able-bodied adult child. Novak v. Chicago & Calumet Dist. Transit Co., 235 Ind. 489, 493, 135 N.E.2d 1, 3 (1956).

He stayed in jail for two or three months and was released on probation. On December 8, 2000, he was arrested for violating his probation and was in jail until March 20, 2001, when he transfe could form a firm belief that reasonable efforts had been made to return the children to Arredondo but he did not regularly visit them or maintain contact with them.

In this case, Arredondo was initially arrested for injury to a child in June 2000 and was released on probation after spending two or three months in jail. However, he was arrested again on December 8, 2000, for violating his probation. The relevant legal principle is that violating probation can lead to further consequences and potential re-incarceration. Arredondo stayed in jail until March 20, 2001, due to these probation violations. The impact of these violations on the legal proceedings is that they may have affected the court's decision regarding the custody of the children involved. It is crucial to consider these probation violations when analyzing the overall case and determining appropriate actions or consequences. <end>"

There are conflicting decisions in Georgia courts, with some cases holding that the statute of frauds does not apply to promissory estoppel claims. <analysis> Based on the passage, Dr. Johnson's promissory estoppel claim failed because she failed to present evidence of reasonable reliance. The district court granted summary judgment on this claim, citing the statute of frauds as a bar. However, the passage also states that Georgia law is unclear on whether the statute of frauds can defeat a claim of promissory estoppel. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the statute of frauds can be used as a defense against a claim of promissory estoppel under Georgia law. <answer> Under Georgia law, it is unclear whether the statute of frauds can defeat a claim of promissory estoppel. While the district court in Dr. Johnson's case held that the statute of frauds barred her promissory estoppel claim, there are conflicting decisions in Georgia courts on this issue. Some cases have held that the statute of frauds does not apply to promissory estoppel claims. Therefore, it depends on the specific facts and circumstances of each case whether the statute of frauds can be used as a defense against a claim of promissory estoppel under Georgia law. <end>"

However, according to the insurer's duty to define exclusionary clauses clearly, the second sentence may have purposeful clarifying language. The courts may not interpret a policy in a way that renders any part superfluous, especially if it is inconsistent with the structure and format of the provision or if it is otherwise unreasonable.

This change indicates a difference in the legal framework and suggests that the interpretation and reliance on the previous provisions, such as the case of In re Edgar, may no longer be valid. The Edgar decision was based on the interpretation of Section 70(a)(5) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, which is no longer applicable under the current Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, the change in concept renders the Edgar decision and its interpretation of the old provision irrelevant in the present controversy governed by Section 541(a)(5)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code. <answer> The significance of the change in concept between the previous provisions in Section 70(a)(5) of the Bankruptcy Act and Section 541(a)(5)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code is that it indicates a shift in the legal framework.

The Edgar decision was based on the interpretation of Section 70(a)(5) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, which is no longer applicable under the current Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, the Edgar decision and its interpretation of the old provision no longer represent the controlling law under the Code. The present controversy is instead governed by Section 541(a)(5)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code.

Reasoning that the legislature had not given authority to a county to impose such a fee, the trial court concluded that Broward County lacked such authority. It also found that under state law, the county is preempted from imposing such a fee. Upon finding the county’s annual occupancy fee invalid, the trial court declared the entire ordinance void and unenforceable. Broward County argues that because it is a charter county it is vested with municipal powers. It thus has authority to charge telecommunications companies for use of their rights-of-way and such authority was not preempted by state law. We agree.

Murphy argues that the state court unreasonably applied clearly established Federal law when it dismissed the lone holdout juror during deliberations after the trial judge concluded that the juror refused to deliberate. Murphy, however, cites no Supreme Court case which holds that the dismissal of a juror for refusing to deliberate violates a criminal defendant’s Sixth Amendment right. Indeed, there are no Supreme Court holdings addressing the issue of whether a trial court’s discharge of a juror for refusing to deliberate violates the Sixth Amendment.

As the parties agree, this creates a divisible statute because “dangerous weapon” is not defined in the offense conduct; thus not all armed robberies would constitute firearm offenses. The analysis of a divisible statute in the immigration context is analogous to the application of sentencing enhancements in the sentencing context. In the sentencing context, the court applies Taylor v.

Gen. L. ch 265 § 17. It raises the issue of the definition of a 'dangerous weapon' in the offense conduct, specifically in relation to armed robberies that may or may not involve a firearm. <rules> The relevant legal rule in this case is that the statute imposes a minimum sentence of not less than five years for the offense of having features artificially distorted, and for committing any offense while armed with a firearm. However, 'dangerous weapon' is not defined in the offense conduct, making it a divisible statute that does not categorize all armed robberies as firearm offenses. <analysis> The analysis of a divisible statute in the immigration context is similar to the application of sentencing enhancements in the sentencing context. In the sentencing context, the court applies the holding of Taylor v. United States, which sets a precedent for determining whether a prior conviction qualifies as a violent felony. In the immigration context, a similar approach is taken to determine whether an offense falls under the category of a 'firearm offense' based on the definition of a 'dangerous weapon'. <answer> The debate in the legal passage centers around the application of a divisible statute created by Mass. Gen. L. ch 265 § 17. The passage highlights that the statute does not define the term 'dangerous weapon' in relation to the offense conduct, leading to the question of whether all armed robberies would constitute firearm offenses. The legal analysis suggests that the analysis of a divisible statute in the immigration context is comparable to the application of sentencing enhancements in the sentencing context, where prior convictions are examined to determine if they qualify as violent felonies. In the immigration context, the determination of whether an offense falls under the category of a 'firearm offense' is based on the definition of a 'dangerous weapon'.

With respect to the substantive reasonable of <question> Why is Portney's argument foreclosed by the precedent? <issues> The issue is whether Portney's argument is foreclosed by the precedent. <rules> The rule is that if a similar argument challenging a specific guideline has already been rejected by the court, then subsequent arguments on the same issue are foreclosed by that precedent. <analysis> In this case, Portney argues that the Guidelines relating to U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2 should be given little weight because they were developed based on Congressional mandate, not empirical data. However, the court has already rejected a similar argument challenging § 2G2.2 in a previous case (Pugh, 515 F.3d at 1201 n. 15). Therefore, Portney's argument is foreclosed by the precedent established in that case (United States v. Archer, 531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008)). <answer> Portney's argument is foreclosed by the precedent because a similar argument challenging the specific guideline has already been rejected by the court. The court has previously held that the Guidelines relating to U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2 should be given weight, and this precedent applies to Portney's argument as well. Therefore, Portney cannot rely on this argument to challenge his sentence. <end>"

Id., K-Stemcell and Biostar have not raised a challenge to the agreement to arbitrate that is “specific to the arbitration clause itself’. Because Biostar’s and K-Stemcell’s challenge to the motion to compel attacks the enforceability of the entire Agreement, the trial court did not err in submitting the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator.

Position #2: A debtor can assert an ECOA violation as an affirmative defense in the nature of recoupment. Many federal and state jurisdictions have allowed a plaintiff to assert an ECOA violation as an affirmative defense, even after the two-year statute of limitations has run for an offensive ECOA claim, by way of recoupment.

See Bernal, 2006-NMSC-050, ¶ 20, 140 N.M. 644, 146 P.3d 289 (<HOLDING>); State v. Stone, 2008-NMCA-062, ¶¶ 19-25, 144 <question> What specific aspects or matters are being debated or questioned? <issues> Whether the defendant's actions of damaging gravestones can be considered as multiple convictions or a single incident. <rules> The court case Morro, 1999-NMCA-118, ¶ 1, 127 N.M. 763, 987 P.2d 420 is relevant. Additionally, the concept of double jeopardy proscription is applicable. <analysis> The court in Morro, 1999-NMCA-118, ¶ 1, 127 N.M. 763, 987 P.2d 420 upheld multiple convictions for damaging gravestones, even if all the damage occurred in a single incident. Therefore, the defendant's actions can be considered as multiple convictions. The argument that the defendant fulfilled an overall plan or scheme to deceive different victims at different times does not convert the actions into two offenses. Additionally, the double jeopardy proscription does not require the separate convictions to be merged into one for punishment purposes with respect to the defendant's unlicensed status or the unregistered security status for each transaction. The court cases Bernal, 2006-NMSC-050, ¶ 20, 140 N.M. 644, 146 P.3d 289 and State v. Stone, 2008-NMCA-062, ¶¶ 19-25, 144 are also relevant in supporting this analysis. <answer> Based on the provided passage and the relevant court cases Morro, 1999-NMCA-118, ¶ 1, 127 N.M. 763, 987 P.2d 420, Bernal, 2006-NMSC-050, ¶ 20, 140 N.M. 644, 146 P.3d 289, and State v. Stone, 2008-NMCA-062, ¶¶ 19-25, 144, it can be concluded that the defendant's actions of damaging gravestones can be considered as multiple convictions even if all the damage occurred in a single incident. The argument that the defendant fulfilled an overall plan or scheme to deceive different victims at different times does not convert the actions into two offenses. Furthermore, the double jeopardy proscription does not require merging the separate convictions into one for punishment purposes in relation to the defendant's unlicensed status or the unregistered security status for each transaction. <end>"
